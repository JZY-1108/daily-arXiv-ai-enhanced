### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC模型用于在线科学学习讨论中的知识构建水平自动分类，通过改进的DeBERTa-v3结合Focal Loss等技术，在YouTube科学频道数据上取得了0.836的宏F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够自动识别在线科学学习环境中知识构建水平的工具，以支持大规模数字学习环境中的话语分析和认知参与评估。

Method: 扩展DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化技术，处理类别不平衡问题并增强泛化能力，构建端到端的可复现流程。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC获得0.836±0.008的宏F1分数，显著优于传统和transformer基线模型，对高阶认知参与（特别是Explore和Negotiate类别）表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识构建的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估提供了可扩展的理论驱动方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了五个主流大语言模型生成高中物理课程计划的质量，发现模型选择主要影响可读性，而提示框架结构对事实准确性和教学完整性影响更大。最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型与RACE框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI生成课程计划的教学合理性和可用性，比较不同大语言模型和提示框架在生成教育内容方面的表现差异。

Method: 使用五个大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15个高中物理课程计划，通过四个自动化计算指标进行分析：可读性、事实准确性、课程标准对齐度和认知需求。

Result: DeepSeek生成最易读的教学计划，Claude语言密度最高；RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数和最高的课程标准对齐度；所有模型的学习目标主要集中在布鲁姆分类法的低阶认知层面。

Conclusion: 可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程对齐度更依赖提示框架。最佳实践是结合可读性优化的模型、RACE框架和明确的概念清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动修正而非被动去噪来解决并行解码中的错误级联问题，显著提升生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在视觉语言任务中具有潜力，但存在训练-推理差异导致的错误级联问题：初始令牌错误会污染生成上下文，引发连锁错误反应，导致语法错误和语义幻觉。

Method: 提出ReDiff框架，将生成过程从被动去噪重构为主动修正。采用两阶段训练：首先训练模型修正合成错误建立基础修正能力；然后通过在线自修正循环，训练模型修正自己的错误草稿，学习专家修正。

Result: 实验表明ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: ReDiff通过错误驱动学习赋予模型重新审视和修正已生成输出的能力，有效打破了错误级联，为离散扩散模型的实用化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sparse Tracing技术，通过动态稀疏注意力高效分析长上下文注意力模式，解决了传统方法在百万token上下文下内存需求过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展到百万token上下文，传统注意力分析技术因二次方复杂度需要TB级内存，无法处理超过10万token的长上下文。

Method: 引入Stream算法，通过分层剪枝估计每个头的稀疏注意力掩码，在近线性时间和线性空间内实现一次性可解释性分析。

Result: 在长思维链推理中识别思维锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互；在RULER基准上保留关键检索路径，剪枝90-96%交互，暴露从针到输出的层间路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上可行，有助于民主化思维链监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种利用大语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本以确定患者HIV检测资格的创新流程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV高效筛查和早期诊断对减少传播至关重要，现有研究主要关注结构化数据而忽视了临床笔记等非结构化文本数据中可能包含的HIV风险相关信息

Method: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的流程来分析非结构化EHR文本数据，评估患者是否适合进行进一步HIV检测

Result: 在伊拉斯谟大学医学中心鹿特丹的临床数据上实验显示，该流程实现了高准确率且保持了低假阴性率

Conclusion: 该研究证明了利用LLM分析非结构化EHR文本在HIV筛查中的有效性，为改进HIV诊断提供了新途径

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次对大型语言模型在生命周期评估中的表现进行了专家基准测试，评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务中的表现，发现37%的响应包含不准确信息，但某些模型在解释质量和格式遵循方面表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和LLM在生命周期评估中的应用日益增多，但缺乏对其可靠性、鲁棒性和可用性的系统性评估。该研究旨在填补这一空白，为LCA领域提供标准化的LLM评估框架。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM（包括商业和开源模型）在22个LCA相关任务中的表现，由17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准对模型输出进行评审，共收集168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判断37%的响应包含不准确或误导性信息；准确性和解释质量评分普遍为中等或良好；幻觉率差异显著，某些模型的幻觉引用率高达40%；开源模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上与闭源模型表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LCA中简单应用LLM的风险，特别是当将LLM视为自由形式的神谕时，但也显示了LLM在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的益处。没有基础机制支持的通用LLM使用存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了基于游戏的评估方法来全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLMs），使用Dixit卡牌游戏作为具体实现，通过竞争性游戏环境克服传统基准测试的主观性和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLM评估方法存在静态基准无法综合评估、人工或模型对比主观性强且成本高、模型可能利用表面特征（如冗长）来提升胜率等问题，需要更全面客观的评估框架。

Method: 采用基于游戏的评估方法，具体使用Dixit幻想卡牌游戏，玩家需要为卡片生成能迷惑部分但非全部玩家的描述，通过竞争性游戏环境综合评估MLM能力。

Result: 五个MLM在Dixit游戏中的胜率排名与流行MLM基准测试排名完全相关，同时人类与MLM玩家的游戏揭示了代理策略差异和MLM推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估为MLM提供了更全面、客观和吸引人的评估框架，能够有效克服传统评估方法的局限性，并揭示模型能力的真实差异。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估DeepSeek-R1模型在运筹学优化建模中的应用潜力，通过四种基准测试和多种缓解策略来减少幻觉并提高模型输出准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖领域专家将实际问题转化为数学模型，LLMs有望通过自然语言理解和代码生成能力弥合这一建模差距，但现有模型存在高成本和幻觉问题。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-R1模型，在NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP和ComplexOR四个基准上进行系统评估，采用LLM-as-a-Judge、Few-shot Learning、Tool Calling和多智能体框架等缓解策略。

Result: DeepSeek-R1作为成本效益高且性能良好的模型，在LiveCodeBench和Math-500等基准上表现优异，但在应用运筹学场景中的有效性仍需探索。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1在运筹学优化建模中具有应用潜力，通过适当的缓解策略可以有效减少幻觉并提高模型输出的准确性。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的框架，使预训练大语言模型能够通过存储实例级批评和语义级指导来学习目标分类函数，无需参数更新，相比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升达24.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、灵活性差且不透明，需要探索无需参数更新就能让LLM从标记示例中学习的方法。

Method: 使用记忆增强框架，包含存储具体经验的实例级批评的片段记忆和提炼为可重用任务指导的语义记忆，结合标记数据和LLM生成的批评。

Result: 在多样化任务集上，整合批评相比仅依赖标签的检索基线准确率提升最高达24.8%，揭示了OpenAI和开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思性学习为构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM智能体提供了前景，模型特性和记忆策略共同塑造学习动态。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个无监督的歌词翻译框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在段落级别实现更好的翻译质量，训练步骤减少40%且性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐-语言模式，在段落级别缺乏跨行连贯性和全局韵律处理能力。

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计师和自适应课程策略，以无监督方式逐步引导模型学习更复杂的挑战。

Result: 在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务中达到最先进水平，在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上均超越强基线，训练步骤减少近40%。

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过自适应课程学习有效解决了歌词翻译中的多约束平衡问题，实现了高效训练和高质量翻译。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988)
*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合方法，将大语言模型的广泛覆盖能力与符号自然语言理解系统的结构化表示能力相结合，以解决LLM的幻觉问题和符号系统的覆盖限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉和输出不一致问题，而符号NLU系统虽然提供可解释的结构化表示，但覆盖范围有限且需要专业知识维护。希望结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用LLM进行重述和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，同时使用符号NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的结构化关系表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果规律的任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了LLM的广泛覆盖和符号NLU的结构化表示优势，在特定任务上取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于依赖关系的自然语言句子解析算法，采用逐词处理方式，在可以附加时立即附加每个词，模拟人脑解析机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种模拟人脑解析机制的自然语言解析算法，不同于短语结构解析器，采用逐词处理方式，在可以附加时立即附加每个词。

Method: 提出了一种依赖关系解析算法，逐词处理句子，每个词在可以附加时立即附加到依赖树中，模拟人脑的解析过程。

Result: 该算法的最坏情况复杂度为O(n^3)，但在人类语言中，最坏情况仅出现在小规模n的情况下。

Conclusion: 该依赖关系解析算法能够有效模拟人脑的解析机制，虽然理论复杂度较高，但在实际人类语言处理中表现良好。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一范式来评估临床决策任务，通过临床背景和临床问题两个维度来表征，指出随着背景和问题接近真实临床环境，难度会增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学数据集如MedQA依赖简化的问答形式，不能充分代表真实世界的临床决策过程，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出二维评估范式（临床背景和临床问题），总结现有数据集设置，回顾训练时和测试时的技术方法，并扩展评估维度到效率、可解释性等。

Result: 建立了一个系统化的临床决策评估框架，能够更准确地反映LLMs在真实临床环境中的表现。

Conclusion: 该范式能够澄清假设、标准化比较，并指导开发具有临床意义的LLMs，同时指出了未来面临的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

Conclusion: 通过质量驱动的数据策划和多样化的现代架构应用，成功开发了针对希腊语的高性能嵌入模型，特别是在法律领域取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

TL;DR: 本博士论文通过引入多任务模型、架构修改方法和生成式上下文微调框架，改进了预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果仍有提升空间，特别是在领域迁移、信息流方向和生成式应用方面需要针对性改进。

Method: 1) 多任务模型结合领域无关文本处理系统的额外信号；2) 修改自回归大语言模型架构实现层间双向信息流；3) 生成式监督上下文微调框架结合响应导向适应策略。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架表明，通过针对性迁移学习范式，预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中的性能可以通过三种针对性迁移学习改进方法得到显著提升，包括多任务学习、架构修改和生成式上下文微调。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

TL;DR: ToolScope通过工具合并和检索机制解决LLM工具使用中的冗余和上下文限制问题，显著提升工具选择准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界工具集存在冗余工具，工具名称和描述重叠导致歧义，降低选择准确性；同时LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效考虑大型工具集

Method: ToolScope包含两个组件：(1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction自动审核和修复工具合并，减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever对每个查询进行工具排序和选择，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制

Result: 在三个最先进LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，工具选择准确率提升8.38%至38.6%

Conclusion: ToolScope有效增强了LLM工具使用能力，解决了工具冗余和上下文限制的关键挑战

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Motivation: 现有多语言基准在捕捉低资源文化细微差别方面存在不足，需要专门评估模型在低资源文化知识上的能力。

Method: 创建包含民俗传统、烹饪艺术和地区方言的孟加拉语文化知识数据集BLanCK，并调查多个多语言语言模型的表现。

Result: 模型在非文化类别表现良好，但在文化知识方面显著困难；提供上下文后所有模型性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: 需要上下文感知架构和文化精心策划的训练数据来提升模型在低资源文化知识上的表现。

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

TL;DR: 使用RLAIF和DPO方法增强波斯语小语言模型的医学推理能力，通过翻译医学问答数据集并生成推理轨迹对，在少量数据下显著提升了模型的医学推理表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强小语言模型在专门应用（如医学问答）中的推理能力，特别是在波斯语等资源匮乏语言中，解决数据有限的问题。

Method: 将医学问答数据集翻译成波斯语，使用RLAIF生成拒绝-偏好答案对，通过教师和学生模型生成CoT推理响应，构建包含正确和错误推理轨迹的数据集用于DPO训练。

Result: 训练后的模型在医学推理能力上显著提升，仅使用450万token的数据就超越了使用5700万token训练的前代模型gaokerena-V。

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在数据有限的情况下，能够高效开发领域特定的语言模型，证明了小数据集也能实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，用于全面评估大语言模型的创造力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估方法零散且不一致，缺乏统一的评估框架，需要系统性地衡量模型在不同场景下的创造力。

Method: 设计CreativityPrism框架，包含3个维度（质量、新颖性、多样性）、9个任务、3个领域（发散思维、创意写作、逻辑推理）和20个评估指标，评估了17个最先进的专有和开源大语言模型。

Result: 专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距；同一领域内任务表现高度相关，不同领域间相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标强相关，新颖性与其他维度相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 创造力评估需要多维度、多任务的全面框架，单一任务或维度的表现不能代表整体创造力水平。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

TL;DR: ARTER提出了一种无需深度微调的实体链接方法，通过自适应路由和针对性推理，在保持高效的同时实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有的少样本方法虽然减少了训练需求，但LLM推理成本高昂。

Method: 采用结构化流水线：候选生成、基于上下文的评分、自适应路由和选择性推理，结合嵌入和LLM信号将实体分为简单和困难两类分别处理。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER比ReFinED性能提升高达4.47%，平均提升2.53%，与全LLM推理方法性能相当但效率提高一倍。

Conclusion: ARTER证明了通过智能路由策略，可以在不牺牲性能的前提下显著降低实体链接的计算成本。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种高效的文本分割方法，通过生成起始标记序列来重构完整内容，大幅降低推理成本并减少幻觉。该方法结合强化学习和中间候选策略，在复杂结构化文本分割任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告和生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统基于句子或段落的分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的文本，需要更有效的语义分割方法。

Method: BoundRL采用联合执行标记级文本分割和标签预测的方法，通过生成起始标记序列来重构内容。使用带可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)优化文档重构保真度和语义对齐，并通过系统扰动生成中间候选来缓解熵崩溃问题。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小语言模型(1.7B参数)在复杂提示分割任务中优于大模型的少样本提示。RLVR相比监督微调有显著改进，加入中间候选策略进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为复杂结构化文本的分割提供了一种高效解决方案，通过创新的起始标记生成和强化学习框架，在保持高质量分割的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型在立场检测任务中的偏见问题，发现LLMs在零样本设置下表现出显著的刻板印象，如将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度错误关联，将非裔美国方言与反对特朗普立场错误关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从预训练数据中继承了刻板印象，导致在NLP任务中对某些社会群体产生偏见行为。令人惊讶的是，立场检测方法中的这种偏见评估被社区大大忽视了。立场检测是最敏感的NLP任务之一，常涉及政治倾向。

Method: 在现有立场检测数据集中自动标注帖子的两个属性：特定群体的方言/语言变体和文本复杂度/可读性，研究这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，例如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非裔美国方言与反对特朗普的立场关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在零样本立场检测中存在显著的偏见问题，需要进一步研究和解决这些刻板印象问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Motivation: 当前搜索代理缺乏同时进行深度多跳推理和广域信息收集的能力，这对于实际应用如市场分析和业务发展至关重要。

Method: 通过两种方法转换现有数据集，构建了包含220个问题的基准，要求代理处理大量数据并进行深度多跳检索推理。

Result: 实验显示最先进代理的平均成功率仅为2.39%，错误分析揭示了四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch基准揭示了当前代理架构在整合深度和广度搜索方面的关键局限性，旨在推动更强大信息搜索代理的研究。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：基于微调的方法容易产生算术错误和幻觉，基于工具的方法缺乏语义理解且依赖固定模式。需要整合强大推理能力与可靠表格处理的方法。

Method: 使用多智能体框架，将任务分解为三个专门角色：规划、编码和回答。采用自改进训练框架，使用MCTS生成伪黄金轨迹，并通过强化学习优化智能体。

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流程与强化学习，在表格理解方面展现出巨大潜力，为表格推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在文本输入上的空间推理能力，评估它们从语言理解到空间几何推理的转换能力，揭示当前模型的局限性。

Method: 设计了五个空间推理任务：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动，通过增加网格维度来提升任务复杂度，测试模型从简单模式识别到抽象空间推理的能力。

Result: LLMs在小规模任务中表现中等，但随着复杂度增加性能急剧下降，平均准确率下降42.7%，最高达84%。所有初始准确率超过50%的测试都至少下降48%，显示性能恶化的普遍性。

Conclusion: LLMs在空间推理方面存在显著局限性，缺乏稳健的空间表示架构，凸显了语言推理与空间推理之间的差距，为未来语言与几何交叉领域的基准测试奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需解码的采样策略来近似计算语言模型对文本的边际概率，避免了传统采样方法需要昂贵生成步骤的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在推理时只评估特定分词输出的概率，而忽略同一文本可能有多种分词方式。边际化评估虽然更准确，但传统采样方法需要大量生成步骤，计算成本高昂。

Method: 采用解码无关的采样策略，不依赖语言模型生成，而是使用模型和分词器无关的廉价采样方法，通过计算给定分词序列的概率来近似边际概率。

Result: 实验表明，解码无关采样策略能以极小的运行时成本提供足够准确的边际概率估计，并在多个下游推理任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略为语言模型的边际概率评估提供了一种高效可行的替代方案，显著降低了计算成本同时保持了评估准确性。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，通过融合文本、音频和面部信号来评估抑郁症和PTSD的严重程度，在多模态融合中表现出优于单模态方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症和创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)经常共病且症状相互关联，但现有的自动化评估通常是二元分类且针对单一障碍。临床上需要能够提供严重程度感知的跨障碍评估和决策支持解释。

Method: 开发了三模态情感严重程度框架：同步融合访谈文本（句子级transformer嵌入）、音频（log Mel统计特征）和面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部姿态描述符），通过校准的后期融合分类器输出抑郁症（PHQ-8；5个等级）和PTSD（3个等级）的分级严重程度。

Result: 在DAIC数据集上的分层交叉验证显示，融合模型在准确率和加权F1分数上匹配最强单模态基线，同时提高了决策曲线效用和在噪声或缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并改善了类别一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供了可重复的评估和临床医生在环支持，其中文本对抑郁症严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要，归因分析与语言和行为标记一致。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context预测目标来增强标准预训练，在保持与自回归评估兼容的同时，提升语言模型对高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统next-token预测限制了模型捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系的能力，需要新的训练目标来克服这一局限。

Method: 在标准预训练基础上增加next-context预测目标，训练模型学习多token上下文的预测表示，利用未来token块产生的误差信号。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族上的实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致改进，模型参数规模可达15亿。

Conclusion: next-context预测为语言建模提供了可扩展且高效的增强途径，能以最小计算开销实现更好的长距离连贯性和注意力分配效果。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将RAG系统中的引用失败与响应失败区分开，研究引用失败的原因并提出CITENTION框架来改进LLM引用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based RAG系统的引用本应简化响应验证，但当模型生成有用响应却未能完整引用证据时，就出现了引用失败。与之前工作不同，本文将其与响应失败（响应本身有缺陷）区分开来。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 研究引用失败的发生条件，引入CITECONTROL基准分析响应与证据关系对引用质量的影响；2) 提出CITENTION框架，整合生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法来改进引用。

Result: 实验表明，失败率随关系复杂性增加而上升，结合多种引用方法可提升性能。CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中都显著改善了引用效果。

Conclusion: 成功区分了引用失败与响应失败，提出的CITECONTROL基准和CITENTION框架有效解决了LLM引用问题，数据与代码已公开。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估过程奖励模型在表格问答任务中的表现，发现结合文本和代码验证的PRMs能帮助选择答案，但在跨域数据上泛化能力不足，且步骤级验证与答案准确性之间相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程奖励模型在数学等复杂推理任务中表现良好，但在涉及半结构化数据的表格问答任务中的应用尚未探索。TQA存在信息冗余、推理步骤松散、领域特定推理等独特挑战。

Method: 对表格问答任务中的最先进生成式PRMs进行评估，从答案和步骤两个角度分析，结合文本和代码验证的方法。

Result: PRMs能辅助解决方案选择，但在跨域数据上泛化困难；步骤级验证性能与答案准确性之间相关性较弱，可能源于步骤依赖性和因果联系松散。

Conclusion: 当前PRMs在表格问答任务中存在局限性，为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂数学运算中表现不佳，虽然集成代码解释器是潜在解决方案，但模型内部概率推理与外部确定性知识之间的冲突导致无效的思考过程。

Method: 提出Hint-Engineering数据合成策略，在推理路径的关键点注入多样化提示，生成高质量的代码集成推理数据；通过监督微调、拒绝采样和强化学习优化模型与代码解释器的多轮交互。

Result: 在五个挑战性数学推理数据集上，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B和1.5B模型分别获得4%和8%的绝对性能提升；32B和1.5B模型的token使用量分别减少约30%和50%。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器集成时的冲突问题，显著提升了数学推理性能和效率，为模型与外部工具的有效协作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能部分源于对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的泛化能力，特别是当数据集包含强语义线索时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽略了数据集污染这一关键混淆因素。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，研究LLMs是否对广泛使用的表格基准数据集（如Adult Income、Titanic等）具有先验知识。

Result: 当数据集包含强语义线索（如含义明确的列名或可解释的值类别）时，污染效应出现；当这些线索被移除或随机化时，性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: 需要改进评估协议并提出策略，以在未来LLM评估中区分语义泄漏与真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

TL;DR: FreeChunker是一个跨粒度编码框架，通过将句子作为原子单元，从静态分块转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，显著提升RAG系统的检索性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块方法采用固定粒度范式，依赖静态边界识别，限制了其对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: 提出FreeChunker框架，将句子作为原子单元，从静态分块转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker相比传统分块方法实现了更优的检索性能，并在计算效率上显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过范式转变，不仅显著降低了语义边界检测的计算开销，还增强了对复杂查询的适应性。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 探究仅使用对话数据进行预训练是否能产生形式上和功能上都合适的小语言模型

Method: 基于llamalogue模型，采用PPO和DPO等多种微调策略来增强模型的对话生成能力

Result: 模型在标准BabyLM基准测试中表现不佳，但在最小对设置下的对话延续预测中表现出色；DPO微调进一步提升了对话基准测试性能

Conclusion: 对话专用预训练能产生有效的对话模型，DPO微调比PPO更有效

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在肯定文本中的幻觉问题，但否定文本对幻觉的影响尚未充分探索。本文旨在解决三个重要但未回答的研究问题。

Method: 通过重构现有幻觉检测数据集创建NegHalu数据集，研究LLMs是否能识别否定引起的上下文变化并可靠检测幻觉。同时追踪LLMs处理否定输入时的内部状态。

Result: 实验表明LLMs在否定文本中检测幻觉效果不佳，常产生逻辑不一致或不忠实的判断。内部状态分析揭示了缓解否定意外影响的挑战。

Conclusion: 否定文本显著影响LLMs的幻觉检测能力，需要开发更有效的方法来处理否定表达带来的挑战。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BERT模型在各种任务上表现出色，但其架构选择相比Llama3和Qwen3等新型transformer模型已显过时。ModernBERT和NeoBERT在英语基准测试上显示出显著改进，本文旨在为希伯来语文本开发类似的先进模型。

Method: 使用与NeoBERT相同的架构训练BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本进行优化，包括单语和双语版本。

Result: NeoDictaBERT模型在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中都超越了现有模型，NeoDictaBERT-bilingual在检索任务上表现尤其突出，超越了类似规模的多语言模型。

Conclusion: 这些模型为希伯来语NLP的下游任务提供了强大基础，作者将模型发布给社区以推动希伯来语NLP的研究和发展。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Motivation: 儿童与照顾者之间的多轮对话具有连贯性特征，即对话者之间及时、直接且有意义的交流。本文旨在评估和改进BabyLM在多轮对话中的连贯性。

Method: 引入ContingentChat教师-学生框架，使用新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，并采用自适应教师解码策略。

Result: BabyLM生成的回复在语法和连贯性方面有所改善，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外增益有限。

Conclusion: ContingentChat展示了针对性后训练对对话质量的益处，同时表明连贯性对于BabyLM来说仍然是一个具有挑战性的目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量指令数据稀缺，而大量低质量数据被丢弃造成信息浪费。需要有效方法将低质量数据转化为高质量训练数据。

Method: 构建MIXTURE数据集（144K样本），提出LM-Mixup方法：先在MIXTURE上监督微调，再用强化学习优化，使用质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个奖励信号。

Result: 仅使用约3%数据集蒸馏的数据进行微调，效果超越全数据集训练，并与最先进的高质量数据选择方法相当。

Conclusion: 低质量数据经适当蒸馏后是宝贵资源，LM-Mixup能显著提升指令调优LLMs的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出具有不同程度的不确定性和正确性，实际可靠性无法保证，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上系统评估四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA，使用最先进的开源LLM进行实验。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉了模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法在整体可靠性方面表现最好，提高了校准度和正确答案的区分度。

Conclusion: 讨论了各种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中选择不确定性度量提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Motivation: 解决LLM持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，同时避免依赖历史数据和任务标签，实现多领域知识的无缝整合。

Method: 基于层间隐藏表征计算模型间相似度，通过自适应分层参数融合来对齐知识，浅层保留通用特征，深层适应具体任务。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多种持续学习场景中，RECALL在知识保留和泛化能力方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于持续演进LLM，有效抵抗灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

*Tim Tian Hua,Andrew Qin,Samuel Marks,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过添加激活向量来抑制大型语言模型评估意识的方法，使模型在评估时表现得像在部署环境中一样，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型有时能检测到它们正在被评估，并调整行为以显得更对齐，这损害了安全评估的可靠性。

Method: 采用两步训练过程：首先在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行持续预训练，然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估设置中使用Python类型提示。最后通过激活向量引导来抑制评估意识。

Result: 研究发现激活向量引导可以有效抑制评估意识，使模型在存在评估线索时仍表现得像在部署环境中。

Conclusion: AI评估者可以通过引导模型使其表现得像在部署环境中，从而提高安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [44] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Robust Preference Selection (RPS)方法，通过方向性邻域共识来增强语言模型对多样化偏好的鲁棒性，无需重新训练即可提升模型在非主流偏好上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在训练数据中主要反映主流偏好，导致对个体化、非主流偏好的覆盖不足，存在偏好覆盖差距。传统方法需要昂贵的重新训练，且难以泛化到完整的偏好谱系。

Method: RPS是一种后处理、无需训练的方法。它从相关偏好的局部邻域中采样多个响应创建候选池，然后选择与用户原始意图最匹配的响应。基于方向性邻域共识的理论框架。

Result: 在三种对齐范式(DPA、DPO、SFT)上的综合实验表明，RPS相比基线方法持续提升鲁棒性，在空间欠表示区域的挑战性偏好上达到69%的胜率。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一个实用且理论可靠的方法，能够增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性，无需模型重新训练即可处理多样化偏好需求。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HSEQ框架，通过分层序列迭代解决多步骤问题和异构证据源的检索增强生成问题，在保持准确性的同时提高效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成在多步骤问题和异构证据源上表现脆弱，需要在准确性、延迟和token/工具预算之间权衡

Method: 将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆分层序列，通过Head Agent和Iteration Agent进行结构感知迭代，收集足够证据后合成答案

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA等数据集上，相比单次传递、多跳和代理RAG基线，EM/F1指标持续提升且效率高

Conclusion: HSEQ框架具有格式无关统一性、预算感知迭代和证据规范化三大优势，能可靠提升问答系统的一致性和可审计性

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

### [46] [Assessing the Political Fairness of Multilingual LLMs: A Case Study based on a 21-way Multiparallel EuroParl Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20508)
*Paul Lerner,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多语言翻译公平性的政治偏见评估方法，通过分析欧洲议会演讲的翻译质量差异来揭示LLMs的政治偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上通过英语调查问卷评估LLMs的政治偏见存在局限，本文旨在通过多语言翻译的公平性原则来重新定义和评估这种偏见。

Method: 使用新构建的21种语言平行语料库EuroParl，系统比较欧洲议会中不同政党演讲的翻译质量，分析翻译差异与政治派别的关系。

Result: 发现主流政党（左翼、中间派、右翼）的演讲翻译质量显著优于边缘政党，表明LLMs存在系统性政治偏见。

Conclusion: 基于翻译公平性的框架能够有效揭示LLMs的政治偏见，为偏见评估提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

### [47] [ARC-Encoder: learning compressed text representations for large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20535)
*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ARC-Encoder，一种可适配的文本表示压缩器，通过将上下文压缩为连续表示来替代解码器LLM中的token嵌入，实现4-8倍的压缩率，提升推理效率同时保持SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成和思维链推理等技术导致上下文变长和推理成本增加，现有上下文压缩方法需要微调目标模型或修改架构，这会降低模型的通用能力。

Method: 设计ARC-Encoder编码器，系统研究训练策略和架构选择，输出比文本token少4-8倍的连续表示，可适配多个解码器LLM。

Result: 在多种LLM使用场景中评估，包括上下文学习和上下文窗口扩展，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，同时提高推理计算效率。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可无缝适配多个LLM，实现跨模型通用性。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder
, fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at

### [48] [The Dog the Cat Chased Stumped the Model: Measuring When Language Models Abandon Structure for Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20543)
*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9720个理解问题的数据集，专门测试语言模型对中心嵌套句的结构理解能力，通过对比语义合理与不合理句子来量化模型何时从结构分析转向语义模式匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法区分语言模型是真正理解句法结构还是仅依赖语义模式匹配，需要开发能够量化这种差异的方法。

Method: 创建CenterBench数据集，包含中心嵌套句及其语义不合理对照版本，设置6种理解问题测试表面理解、句法依赖和因果推理能力，测试6个模型的表现差异。

Result: 模型在合理与不合理句子间的性能差距随复杂度增加而系统性扩大（中位数差距达26.8%），语义合理性在因果推理问题上反而损害性能，推理模型虽提高准确性但显示语义捷径和过度思考。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，揭示了模型与人类在语义效应上的差异，为评估语言模型的结构理解能力提供了新工具。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

*Jinchang Luo,Mingquan Cheng,Fan Wan,Ni Li,Xiaoling Xia,Shuangshuang Tian,Tingcheng Bian,Haiwei Wang,Haohuan Fu,Yan Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GlobalRAG是一个强化学习框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理、迭代优化证据来解决多跳问答中的全局规划缺失和不忠实执行问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在多跳问答中存在两个基本限制：缺乏全局规划来构建多步推理结构，以及不忠实的执行阻碍了有效查询制定和检索证据的一致使用。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架，将问题分解为子目标，协调检索与推理，迭代优化证据。引入规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来引导过程，并采用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线，仅使用8k训练数据（基线训练数据的42%），在EM和F1指标上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化学习有效增强了多跳问答中的全局推理能力，在减少训练数据需求的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

*Zhouwei Zhai,Mengxiang Chen,Haoyun Xia,Jin Li,Renquan Zhou,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，将电商搜索从被动检索转变为主动决策支持，解决传统检索-排序范式与用户多阶段认知决策过程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电商搜索的检索-排序范式依赖于查询-商品匹配，与平台用户的多阶段认知决策过程存在根本性不匹配，导致语义鸿沟、高决策成本和缺乏专业购物指导等问题。

Method: 提出多智能体认知决策框架(MACDF)，通过多智能体系统实现从被动检索到主动决策支持的范式转变。

Result: 离线评估显示MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面显著提升，特别是在涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询中。JD搜索平台的在线A/B测试证实了其实际有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作凸显了多智能体认知系统在重新定义电商搜索方面的变革潜力。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

### [51] [Can ChatGPT Code Communication Data Fairly?: Empirical Evidence from Multiple Collaborative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20584)
*Jiangang Hao,Wenju Cui,Patrick Kyllonen,Emily Kerzabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查了ChatGPT在通信数据自动编码中是否存在性别和种族偏见，发现在协作问题解决框架下，ChatGPT编码未表现出显著的群体偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模评估通信和协作需要将通信数据编码为不同框架的类别，这是一项劳动密集型任务。虽然已有研究表明ChatGPT可以直接按照编码规则对通信数据进行编码，且准确率与人类评分者相当，但其编码是否存在针对不同人口群体（如性别和种族）的偏见尚不清楚。

Method: 使用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，基于ChatGPT对三种类型协作任务（谈判、问题解决和决策制定）的通信数据进行自动编码，并检验不同性别和种族群体间的差异。

Result: 结果表明，基于ChatGPT的编码在性别和种族群体间未表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT编码无显著群体偏见，为其在大规模协作和通信评估中的采用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文基于人类好奇心评估问卷5DCR，构建了评估大语言模型好奇心的框架，发现LLMs比人类更渴求知识但在不确定环境中偏向保守选择，并证实好奇行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否具备类似人类的好奇心驱动学习能力，这是理解LLMs认知能力的重要方面。

Method: 基于人类好奇心评估问卷Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR)，设计了涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求、社会好奇心等维度的综合评估框架。

Result: LLMs表现出比人类更强的知识渴求，但在面对不确定环境时仍倾向于保守选择；好奇行为能显著增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs具备展现类似人类好奇心的潜力，为未来LLMs学习能力和创新研究的发展提供了实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在多语言推理中存在英语偏向，即使面对非英语问题也倾向于用英语推理，导致翻译错误和性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在多语言环境下的推理能力，关注其默认使用英语推理的问题及其对语言文化细微差别处理的影响。

Method: 在MGSM和GPQA Diamond两个任务上，系统比较模型在英语与问题语言中的推理表现，分析推理轨迹中的认知属性。

Result: 英语推理轨迹显示出更高的认知行为存在度，英语推理通常获得更高的答案准确率，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能差距扩大。但英语中心策略存在"翻译迷失"的关键失败模式。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在多语言推理中过度依赖英语，虽然能提高准确率但容易因翻译错误而失败，需要在语言适应性和推理质量间平衡。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粤语虽然使用者众多，但由于政策和双语现象，资源匮乏，缺乏评估框架。

Method: 创建CantoNLU基准测试，涵盖词义消歧、语言可接受性判断、语言检测、自然语言推理、情感分析、词性标注和依存句法分析7个任务；比较了四种模型：未经粤语训练的普通话模型、通过持续预训练获得的粤语适应模型、以及从头训练的粤语单语模型。

Result: 粤语适应模型整体表现最佳，单语模型在句法任务上表现更好，普通话模型在某些场景下仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 当粤语领域数据稀缺时，直接迁移可能足够；发布所有数据集、代码和模型权重以促进粤语NLP研究。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

TL;DR: 该论文提出神经多样性作为减少语言模型幻觉的新机制，通过神经去相关的并行表示，在固定参数和数据预算下降低幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管参数、计算和数据不断增加，语言模型仍然持续产生幻觉。受投资组合理论启发，作者认为去相关的神经表示可以像去相关资产降低风险一样减少幻觉。

Method: 提出ND-LoRA方法，结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，通过促进神经多样性来减少表示相关性。

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉率降低高达25.6%（平均14.6%），且不损害通用准确性。神经相关性增加0.1%与幻觉增加3.8%相关。

Conclusion: 神经多样性是继参数和数据之后的第三个扩展维度，可以在固定预算下提高语言模型的可靠性，不同任务需要不同最优神经多样性水平。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

Motivation: MBR解码在机器翻译中有效，但在对话和指令跟随等开放任务中面临挑战，因为标准相似性效用函数可能选择模型分布中广泛代表性但结构上非最优的响应。

Method: 提出了三种轻量级适配的效用函数，使MBR对结果空间的结构变化更敏感；构建了包含对话行为、情感和响应结构的数据集；提出了两个评估结构最优性的指标。

Result: 实验表明，标准相似性效用函数在结构最优性指标上表现不佳，而提出的适配方法显著改善了结构最优性；在真实世界指令跟随基准测试中，结构敏感性的提升使生成质量提高了13.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 增强MBR对结构变化的敏感性可以有效提升在开放任务中的生成质量，提出的轻量级适配方法在保持MBR优势的同时解决了结构最优性问题。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

### [58] [User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现用户对LLM在隐私敏感场景下的响应质量和帮助性评价存在分歧，而代理LLM与用户评价相关性低，表明隐私和帮助性评价具有个体特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用代理LLM评估隐私保护能力，忽视了真实用户的感知，且主要关注隐私保护质量而忽略了帮助性的细微差异。

Method: 对94名参与者进行了用户研究，使用PrivacyLens的90个场景，比较用户和5个代理LLM对LLM响应的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价。

Result: 用户对相同场景的相同响应在隐私保护质量和帮助性评价上一致性低；代理LLM之间高度一致但与用户评价相关性低。

Conclusion: 隐私和帮助性评价具有个体特异性，代理LLM不能准确反映用户感知，需要进行以用户为中心的研究来改进评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了多种NLP方法，用于从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶类药物治疗和毒性信息。结果显示基于大语言模型的方法表现最佳，特别是错误分析提示法在治疗和毒性提取方面均达到F1=1.000的完美分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶类药物广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但常伴随手足综合征和心脏毒性等不良反应。由于毒性信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要开发有效的NLP方法来提取这些关键信息。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归）、深度学习（BERT、ClinicalBERT）和大语言模型（零样本提示和错误分析提示）的NLP方法，采用80:20的训练测试分割。

Result: 错误分析提示法在治疗和毒性提取方面均达到F1=1.000的最佳性能，零样本提示法在治疗提取上F1=1.000，毒性提取F1=0.876。逻辑回归和SVM在毒性提取中排名第二（F1=0.937）。深度学习方法表现较差，规则方法作为基线F1约0.857。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶类药物治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有强大应用潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析大型推理模型在机器翻译评估中的应用，发现LRM需要定制化评估材料、对简单实例过度思考、评分机制导致高估等问题，提出通过训练合成的人类思考轨迹来校准LRM思考，显著降低思考成本并提升评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中展现出强大的推理能力，但其在机器翻译质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统分析LRM作为评估器的可行性。

Method: 通过训练LRM在合成的人类思考轨迹上进行校准，减少过度思考问题，优化评分机制，在WMT24 Metrics基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 该方法将思考预算降低约35倍，同时在7B到32B不同规模的LRM上均提升了评估性能，如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型相关性提高了8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 高效校准的大型推理模型有潜力推动细粒度自动机器翻译评估的发展，为MT评估提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法主要关注文本生成等高层任务，没有针对特定AI应用场景，无法充分评估模型在公平性等负责任AI维度上的表现。

Method: 构建了一个基于真实应用场景（根据产品特征生成纯文本产品描述）的数据集，通过将公平属性与性别化形容词和产品类别交叉组合，生成丰富的标注提示。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据集识别大语言模型在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 提出了大语言模型评估方案，并为研究社区贡献了具体资源。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然高效，但有限的记忆容量导致遗忘问题，在检索密集型任务中表现不佳。

Method: 结合线性注意力和稀疏注意力，提出可学习的token淘汰方法，使用轻量CNN自适应保留关键KV对，并提供高效的Triton内核实现。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 混合注意力模型在保持线性复杂度同时，显著改善了检索密集型任务的性能。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低在检索增强生成中使用长上下文的计算成本，通过软上下文压缩将输入序列转换为更短的连续表示。

Method: 开发轻量级简单的均值池化方法，训练同一压缩器输出多种压缩比率，并在多个QA数据集、模型家族、规模和压缩比率上进行广泛实验。

Result: 简单的均值池化方法表现最强，训练多种压缩比率时性能下降相对较小，但不同架构和训练机制之间的权衡更为复杂。

Conclusion: 均值池化是有效的软上下文压缩方法，但压缩方法的权衡关系复杂，需要更深入的研究。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM生成文本检测面临定义模糊、检测目标不明确的问题，现有检测器在现实场景中应用有限，结果应被视为参考而非决定性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，检测AI生成文本的需求日益增长，但缺乏对"LLM生成文本"的统一定义，且现实使用场景的复杂性使得检测变得困难。

Method: 通过分析现有检测方法的局限性，指出人类编辑LLM输出和LLM对用户的微妙影响模糊了人机文本的界限，现有基准评估方法未能充分覆盖真实检测场景。

Result: 现有检测器的数值结果常被误解，其意义正在减弱，检测器仅在特定条件下有用。

Conclusion: 检测器在特定条件下仍然有用，但其结果应仅作为参考，而非决定性指标，需要更清晰的检测目标定义和更全面的评估方法。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

Motivation: GAN生成的逼真图像对图像取证和工业系统的内容真实性构成严重挑战，需要可靠的方法来区分真实与合成图像。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到频域，使用ResNet50神经网络在频域图像上进行训练，检测周期性伪影。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征，结合信号处理和深度学习的方法在数字取证和工业AI系统可信度方面具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

Motivation: 解决计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时的挑战，传统CNN方法需要大量标注数据且可能忽略关键的形状关系。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers架构配合对比监督和自监督学习目标，通过ViT理解整体形状，对比学习优化局部判别特征。

Result: 在ModelNet10上达到约90.6%的准确率，验证了ViT与对比学习结合在3D表示学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT与对比学习的结合能够克服传统方法对大量标注数据的依赖，有效捕捉3D形状的全局语义和局部特征，为3D形状理解提供了统一框架。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单传感器跟踪方法性能有限，需要开发能够有效融合多模态传感器特征的多目标跟踪框架，以在遮挡和视角变化下实现鲁棒的重新识别。

Method: 采用基于查询的两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程，集成边界框与多模态BEV融合特征，无需显式运动模型。包含时序平滑器来优化轨迹，减少抖动。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到74.7 aMOTA，显著减少身份切换，在3D MOT基准测试中保持竞争力的准确性。

Conclusion: 基于查询的transformer跟踪方法通过多模态传感器特征显著提升性能，为改进transformer跟踪器提供了高效框架，即使数据有限且无需预训练也能与其他神经网络方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，影响医疗应用的可信度。传统标签平滑方法无法考虑类别间关系，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑（OLS）方法，在训练过程中基于模型自身预测模式动态调整软标签。在RadImageNet数据集上评估了ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS相比硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏方法，持续提升了Top-1和Top-5分类准确率，并产生了更紧凑、分离度更好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅增强了预测性能，还改善了校准效果，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to

TL;DR: 提出一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，通过中间梯度敏感性分数解决3D高斯溅射模型在训练分布外视角下的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射模型在训练数据分布外的相机视角下会产生显著视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏训练数据导致密度、颜色和几何预测不确定。

Method: 利用中间梯度衍生的敏感性分数，明确针对各向异性方向引起的不稳定性，而非各向同性方差。该方法直接处理生成不确定性的核心问题。

Result: 实验评估表明，相比现有基于神经辐射场的方法如BayesRays，该方法显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性。

Conclusion: 该过滤器可实时无缝集成到现有3DGS渲染管线中，无需大量事后重新训练或微调，使3D重建系统在用户自由导航到原始训练视角外时仍能保持高视觉保真度。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [71] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle是一个混合两阶段框架，结合物理建模与机器学习，用于定量经颅超声成像，通过可移动低计数换能器阵列和改进的算法解决传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理全波形反演受颅骨引起的信号衰减、模式转换和相位像差限制，而纯数据驱动方法在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下会产生定量偏差的声速图。

Method: 第一阶段使用逆时偏移处理多角度采集数据生成迁移片段；第二阶段使用基于Transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器与图注意力单元融合片段生成准确声速图像。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验表明，BrainPuzzle在声速重建精度和图像完整性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle展示了推进定量超声脑成像的潜力，通过混合算法补偿缺失孔径，提高了成像可行性。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [72] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个统一评估框架，用于诊断生成式图像模型中的文化偏见，涵盖文本到图像生成和图像到图像编辑，发现模型倾向于默认使用全球北方现代风格，I2I编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，且当前系统无法进行文化敏感的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而对图像到图像编辑器的文化偏见研究不足。该研究旨在填补这一空白，通过标准化协议评估两种系统的文化表现。

Method: 使用统一评估框架，涵盖六个国家、8个类别/36个子类别的分类体系，以及时代感知提示。结合自动指标、文化感知检索增强VQA和本地评审专家的专业判断。

Result: 研究发现：(1)在国家无关提示下，模型默认采用全球北方现代风格描绘，模糊了国家间差异；(2)迭代式I2I编辑会侵蚀文化保真度；(3)I2I模型仅应用表面线索而非时代一致的情境感知变化。

Conclusion: 当前系统中的文化敏感编辑仍不可靠。通过发布标准化数据、提示和人工评估协议，为诊断和追踪生成式图像模型中的文化偏见提供了可复现的文化中心基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [73] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FIBAR方法，一种基于滤波器的异步重建方法，用于从移动事件相机的事件中重建强度图像，相比神经网络方法更简单且能在CPU上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的强度图像重建方法通常需要GPU，计算复杂度高。本文旨在开发一种更简单、异步且能在CPU上高效运行的重建方法。

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器积分事件信号强度变化；通过新颖算法检测陈旧像素；对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波（基于移动相机中无事件区域梯度低的假设）。

Result: FIBAR在笔记本电脑CPU上达到约42(140)百万事件/秒的处理速度（启用/未启用空间滤波）。重建图像比神经网络方法更噪且存在重影，但足以完成某些任务如基准标记检测。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单高效的异步图像重建替代方案，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但在某些应用场景下足够使用，且具有计算效率优势。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TBTLRR模型，通过数据自适应张量核范数和双边结构，结合ℓ1/2范数和Frobenius范数正则化，有效处理图像聚类中的复杂噪声问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换，对噪声鲁棒性差，需要开发更有效的全局相关性和局部相关性捕获方法

Method: 提出TBTLRR模型，学习任意酉变换构建数据自适应张量核范数，利用双边结构捕获局部相关性，集成ℓ1/2范数和Frobenius范数正则化，基于ADMM开发优化算法

Result: 大量实验验证了该方法在聚类任务上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: TBTLRR模型通过自适应变换和双边结构，在图像聚类中表现出优越性能，对复杂噪声具有更好的鲁棒性

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

*Lorenzo Arboit,Dennis N. Schneider,Britty Baby,Vinkle Srivastav,Pietro Mascagni,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源跨平台应用，用于标准化和匿名化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式不统一和隐私问题，通过用户中心设计实现高可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和手术数据科学在手术培训、研究和质量改进中有重要作用，但受限于异构的视频记录格式和视频共享的隐私担忧。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期，结合用户中心反馈。分析阶段通过内部调查确定关键需求，采用隐私设计架构。测试阶段结合可用性启发式和TAM模型评估可用性和采用度。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性（临床医生4.68/5，计算机科学家4.03/5）。优化后，外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）、启发式可用性（4.38/5）和强烈推荐（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了一个透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程，需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证才能成为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [76] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Attentive Convolution (ATConv)，通过引入自适应路由和侧向抑制机制，使卷积操作具备自注意力的表达能力，同时保持线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强，但二次复杂度限制了实际应用。卷积具有线性复杂度，但性能与自注意力存在差距。本文旨在探索自注意力优于卷积的根本原因，并设计兼具两者优势的新算子。

Method: 提出了Attentive Convolution (ATConv)，基于两个关键发现：自适应路由和侧向抑制。ATConv重新构建卷积算子，使其能够根据语义内容动态调节位置信息流，并引入token权重竞争机制抑制冗余。

Result: 仅使用3×3核的ATConv在基础视觉任务中持续优于各种自注意力机制。基于ATConv的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%的Top-1准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散模型中，用ATConv替换所有自注意力可将ImageNet FID降低0.15，采样速度更快。

Conclusion: ATConv成功将自注意力的关键优势融入卷积操作，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了超越自注意力的性能，为视觉主干网络提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

*Jiho Park,Sieun Choi,Jaeyoon Seo,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableSketcher是一个基于扩散模型的框架，专门用于生成像素级手绘草图，通过优化VAE解码器和引入基于视觉问答的强化学习奖励函数，显著提升了草图生成的质量和文本-图像对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成逼真图像方面取得进展，但在生成抽象表达的手绘草图方面仍面临挑战，特别是像素级草图生成的质量和文本提示对齐问题。

Method: 1. 微调变分自编码器优化潜在解码，更好地捕捉草图特征；2. 引入基于视觉问答的新奖励函数进行强化学习，改善文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明StableSketcher在风格保真度方面优于Stable Diffusion基线模型，生成草图与提示词对齐更好。同时创建了首个实例级草图数据集SketchDUO，包含草图-标题-QA对。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了手绘草图生成的挑战，通过技术改进和高质量数据集填补了该领域的研究空白，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文研究使用描述性标题作为生物多模态基础模型的额外监督源，通过多模态大语言模型生成合成标题来弥补实例特异性标题稀缺的问题，训练出的BIOCAP模型在物种分类和图文检索方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物多模态基础模型需要实例特异性描述标题作为监督信号，但获取大规模忠实标题存在挑战，这限制了自然语言监督在生物领域的应用。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科视觉信息和特定分类群格式示例来减少幻觉，获得准确的实例描述标题，并训练BIOCAP模型。

Result: BIOCAP模型能够捕捉丰富的语义信息，在物种分类和图文检索任务中表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签的价值，能够有效连接生物图像与多模态基础模型。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Result: 在多种挑战性数据集上表现良好，无需重新训练或微调，优于相关最先进的新视角合成方法。

Conclusion: 逆图像渲染方法成功从单张图像生成光场，展示了在合成数据集上训练后对真实数据的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

TL;DR: 提出LogitGap方法，通过利用最大logit与其余logits之间的关系来增强ID和OOD样本的可分性，在多种OOD检测场景中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理方法未能充分利用模型logits空间中的丰富信息，需要更有效地利用logits关系来提升OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，利用最大logit与其余logits的关系，并引入无训练策略自动识别最信息丰富的logits子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在多种OOD检测场景和基准测试中一致达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logits空间信息，为OOD检测提供了简单而强大的解决方案，在效率和性能上都有显著提升。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Motivation: 现有组合零样本学习方法在测试时面临由未见属性-对象组合引起的标签空间分布偏移问题，导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 该方法通过累积多模态知识和自适应原型更新，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题，取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

TL;DR: IB-GAN是一种基于GAN的无监督解耦表示学习模型，通过信息瓶颈框架优化GAN，利用生成器的中间层约束输入与生成输出之间的互信息，实现可解释的解耦表示。

Motivation: 利用信息瓶颈框架优化GAN，改进InfoGAN在解耦表示学习方面的性能，实现更好的可解释性和生成质量。

Method: 在GAN架构中引入信息瓶颈框架，通过生成器的中间随机层约束输入与输出的互信息，该中间层作为可学习的潜在分布与生成器端到端联合训练。

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAE相当的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID得分上优于β-VAE和InfoGAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架有效实现了GAN的解耦表示学习，在解耦性能和生成质量方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

Motivation: 解决立体视频深度估计中的时间一致性问题，这对于增强现实等应用至关重要。现有方法在建模长期时间一致性时面临计算效率与性能的权衡困境。

Method: 提出Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM)模块，包含'pick'过程选择最相关帧和'play'过程自适应加权选中的帧进行时空聚合，维持紧凑且信息丰富的记忆缓冲区。

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段记忆构建机制有效解决了立体匹配中的长期时间一致性建模问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 该研究为评估视频生成模型作为世界模拟器提供了严格基准，揭示了当前模型的优势和待改进领域。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Motivation: 现有离散分类方法无法捕捉可疑意图的连续变化特性，限制了早期干预和可解释性。需要建模可疑意图的波动和演化过程。

Method: 提出可疑进展分析网络(SPAN)，定义可疑分数公式建模连续变化，引入可疑系数调制使用多模态信息调整系数，提出概念锚定映射方法将可疑行为与预定义意图概念关联。

Conclusion: 连续可疑建模方法相比离散分类系统能够实现更早检测和主动干预，大大增强了系统可解释性和安全应用的实际效用。

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Motivation: 脑MRI基础模型的发展严重依赖数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但目前对这些因素的系统评估仍然缺乏，需要为模型开发提供结构化的多层级概览。

Method: 在数据集层面分析模态组成、疾病覆盖和规模；在图像层面量化体素间距、方向和强度分布；评估预处理变异性对体素统计和几何的影响；使用3D DenseNet121进行特征空间案例研究。

Result: 发现健康队列与临床人群之间存在强烈不平衡，预处理步骤提高了数据集内一致性但数据集间差异仍然存在，标准化预处理后仍存在可测量的残余协变量偏移。

Conclusion: 公共脑MRI资源存在显著异质性，仅靠数据协调无法消除数据集间偏差，需要采用预处理感知和领域自适应策略来开发泛化性强的脑MRI基础模型。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Motivation: 用户提供的提示通常简短、非结构化且与训练数据不匹配，限制了基于扩散的文本到视频模型的生成潜力。

Result: 在五个最先进的T2V模型和五个基准测试中，RAPO++在语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性方面取得显著提升，大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPO++是一个模型无关、成本高效且可扩展的解决方案，为T2V生成中的提示优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态和循环一致性优化，解决了当前文本到图像编辑方法在忠实修改和源图像一致性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来解决大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时产生的幻觉问题，发现幻觉并非由长度本身引起，而是源于对上下文依赖的增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时更容易产生幻觉，传统观点认为这是由于长度导致的误差累积，但本文质疑这一机制，探索幻觉产生的根本原因。

Method: 提出三步框架：1）通过精心设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉；2）利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测；3）在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 在所有基准测试中都取得了显著且一致的改进，验证了框架的有效性，同时重新验证了关于上下文依赖的假设。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了性能提升，更重要的是为理解LVLMs长文本响应中的幻觉机制提供了新见解，是深入探索该问题的第一步。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态注意力中统一处理所有文本标记，忽视了不同标记的语义角色差异，导致过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而未能有效利用词级信号。

Method: 双分支架构：句子级路径处理[EOS]标记，词标记聚类为短语级单元进行局部定位；引入基于标记角色的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试中，DualGround在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上均达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦的语义建模方法在视频-语言对齐中具有有效性，能够同时捕捉粗粒度和局部语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

TL;DR: 提出EDGeo框架，通过掩码位置编码和上下文增强模块，在跨视角物体地理定位任务中实现最先进性能，定位精度提升3.39%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于关键点的位置编码仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限。

Method: 提出掩码位置编码方案利用分割掩码捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓；设计上下文增强模块使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征；集成MPE和CEM构建EDGeo端到端框架。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在具有挑战性的地面到卫星场景中实现了最先进的性能，定位精度提升3.39%。

Conclusion: 为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了稳健的位置编码范式和上下文建模框架。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视多模态间的语义不一致性（如文本与视觉的情感线索冲突），且常被文本模态主导而影响识别准确率。

Method: CMC包含伪标签生成模块进行自监督单模态预训练，以及参数无关融合模块和多模态共识路由器进行多模态微调。

Result: 在CH-SIMS、CH-SIMS v2、CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI四个数据集上达到或超越SOTA性能，在语义不一致场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，引导融合过程达成更可靠共识，提升多模态情感识别性能。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible
at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在引入文本特征时过于粗糙，忽略了视频片段中可能存在的大量冗余信息，需要利用多模态信息的多样性来精炼提取的特征。

Method: 基于视频片段生成细粒度多模态特征，总结主要内容，并引入原始视频字幕的文本特征来增强突出部分的视觉特征。

Result: 在四个主要数据集上实现了最先进的性能，消融实验验证了性能提升确实源于冗余信息的减少。

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过细粒度多模态特征有效减少了视觉特征中的冗余，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Method: 分析VCR中的因果图和预测捷径，采用后门调整方法消除偏见。具体通过基于正确答案集合创建字典来消除预测捷径。

Conclusion: 提出的去偏方法能够有效解决VCR中的偏见问题，VCR-OOD数据集为评估模型泛化能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Motivation: 解决复杂值合成孔径雷达图像识别中数据有限和领域偏移场景下的表示三难问题——泛化性、可解释性和效率之间的冲突。

Result: 在五个SAR基准测试中实现最先进的参数高效识别，在数据稀缺和分布外场景下表现出色泛化能力。

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析提供了可信赖AI的新路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Conclusion: DMC³框架能有效解决第一人称视频问答中的独特挑战，提升模型性能

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有工作将指令视为用户意图的静态代理，忽视了指令多样性和质量对grounding性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集中23.3%的指令存在缺陷，且利用指令多样性可在推理时获得76%的相对性能提升。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：1）在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调，培养多视角推理能力；2）通过强化学习优化路径选择和组合。模型UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B实现了指令路径的选择性组合和合成。

Conclusion: 指令即推理范式显著提升了GUI grounding性能，模型展现出涌现推理能力，能够选择性组合和合成新的指令路径，同时缓解了SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs需要大量计算资源进行训练，主要原因是广泛使用的视觉编码器（如CLIP、SAM）缺乏与语言在多层次粒度上的对齐。

Method: 利用双曲空间建模层次结构，通过动态双曲半径调整优化视觉表示与文本的对齐；采用可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作，提供三种参数化策略：对角缩放矩阵、块对角矩阵和带状矩阵。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试中，HyperET仅增加不到1%的参数就能显著提升现有预训练和微调MLLMs的性能。

Conclusion: HyperET为多模态大语言模型提供了一种高效的多粒度对齐训练范式，显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Motivation: 解决深度学习点云几何压缩中的泛化挑战，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对OOD数据的低效处理。

Method: 1. 通用上下文模型：利用空间和通道分组先验捕获鲁棒上下文依赖；2. 实例自适应微调(IAFT)：结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调少量网络权重并纳入比特流。

Result: 在包含15个多样化数据集的基准测试中，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过通用上下文模型和IAFT策略有效解决了点云压缩的泛化问题，代码和数据集将开源以促进可重复研究。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中的量化误差会随着去噪步骤累积，传统方法无法有效解决这一问题。

Result: 在多个任务和扩散模型的标准基准测试中证明了方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过考虑多步去噪过程中的误差累积，显著提升了扩散模型的量化性能。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation

TL;DR: 本文发现扩散变换器(DiTs)中补丁标记具有高度独立性，提出位置编码场(PE-Field)将2D位置编码扩展到结构化3D场，在单图像新视角合成和可控空间图像编辑任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现DiTs中补丁标记表现出令人惊讶的独立性：即使位置编码被扰动，DiTs仍能产生全局一致的输出，表明空间一致性主要由位置编码控制。

Method: 提出位置编码场(PE-Field)，将位置编码从2D平面扩展到结构化3D场，包含用于体积推理的深度感知编码和用于细粒度子补丁控制的分层编码。

Result: PE-Field增强的DiT在单图像新视角合成任务上达到最先进性能，并能推广到可控空间图像编辑。

Conclusion: PE-Field使DiTs能够直接在3D空间中建模几何，为视觉生成提供了更强大的架构。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的因果方法，通过预测图像中可能被忽视的烹饪元素，并将其显式注入跨模态表示学习来缓解偏见，提升图像到食谱检索的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱的文本细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致表示学习偏向主导视觉元素，难以区分具有细微差异的相似食谱。

Method: 使用因果方法预测图像中被忽略的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习，以减轻表示偏见。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多元文化数据集上实验，表明该方法能发现细微的食材和烹饪动作，在两个数据集上都取得了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 提出的因果表示学习方法能够有效缓解跨模态表示学习中的偏见，提升图像到食谱检索的准确性，特别是在处理具有细微差异的相似食谱时表现优异。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet模型，通过动态模糊逻辑驱动的知识蒸馏方法处理肺癌分类中的不确定性和复杂性，在LC25000和IQOTH/NCCD数据集上分别达到99.16%和99.54%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识蒸馏方法使用固定权重，无法有效处理医学图像中不同区域的不确定性差异。需要一种能够动态调整蒸馏权重的方法，让学生模型专注于高置信度区域，减少对模糊区域的关注。

Method: 使用ViT-B32作为教师模型，MobileNet作为学生模型，通过模糊逻辑动态调整蒸馏权重。采用动态等待调整机制优化训练过程，使用小波融合方法提升图像质量，并用遗传算法从12个候选模型中选择最优学生模型。

Result: 在LC25000组织病理图像数据集上达到99.16%准确率，在IQOTH/NCCD CT扫描图像数据集上达到99.54%准确率，证明了模型在不同成像领域的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态模糊逻辑驱动的知识蒸馏方法能有效处理医学图像分类中的不确定性，显著提升模型性能，同时通过遗传算法优化实现了计算效率与性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Conan是一个用于证据基础的多步视频推理框架，通过识别上下文和证据帧、跨帧线索推理以及自适应决策，在六个多步推理基准测试中超越基线模型10%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中面临的挑战：基于强化学习的方法产生无根据的结论，而帧检索方法存在证据定位不准确的问题。

Method: 构建Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，设计多阶段渐进冷启动策略和Identification-Reasoning-Action强化学习训练框架。

Result: 在六个多步推理基准测试中，Conan平均准确率比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct高出10%以上，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Conan框架有效提升了多步视频推理能力，并在长视频理解任务中展现出良好的泛化性、可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠基础，并承诺公开数据集元数据、完整代码库、预训练模型和评估工具包以促进透明性和可复现性。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill是一个双向概念蒸馏框架，用于实现一步扩散个性化(1-SDP)，通过师生模型协同训练，在保持生成质量的同时加速文本到图像模型的个性化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单步扩散模型在个性化新概念时能力有限的问题，因为单步模型难以有效捕捉新概念的分布。

Method: 采用端到端训练，多步扩散模型(教师)和单步扩散模型(学生)同时训练，通过双向概念蒸馏机制，包括概念从教师到学生的蒸馏和从学生到教师的反馈，共享文本编码器确保语义一致性，并使用对抗损失和对齐损失优化学生模型。

Result: 实验表明该协作框架在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法，不仅增强了学生模型对新概念的个性化能力，还提高了教师模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型中的快速有效个性化建立了一个新颖的范式，通过双向概念蒸馏机制实现了概念的高效传递和模型性能的共同提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型存在两个关键局限：对简单查询也使用计算昂贵的推理方法导致效率低下；专注于专业推理会损害其更广泛的通用理解能力。

Method: 将原始密集模型重构为两个专家分支：思维分支处理复杂多步推理，非思维分支优化快速直接推理任务。使用轻量级可训练路由器动态分配查询。基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B构建MoE架构。

Result: 该方法不仅显著增强了复杂推理能力，还改善了模型的通用能力，逆转了其他推理专用模型中观察到的性能下降趋势。

Conclusion: 建立了一个构建强大且通用多模态大模型的新范式，有效解决了推理与泛化之间的普遍困境。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在局限性：数据标注不可靠且粒度粗，模型无法输出文本解释与视觉伪影证据之间的连接，也不支持任意面部区域的查询输入，导致响应不够基于面部视觉上下文。

Method: 1. 定义面部图像概念树(FICT)进行细粒度区域划分；2. 开发FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程；3. 提出伪影定位解释(AGE)任务，生成包含分割掩码的文本解释；4. 构建统一多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM，支持丰富多模态输入输出。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线模型，在现有XDFA数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度数据标注和统一多任务架构，有效提升了可解释深度伪造分析的细粒度感知能力，为深度伪造检测提供了更可靠的可解释性支持。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Motivation: 解决相机抖动（特别是大范围或旋转运动）引起的运动模糊问题，传统端到端去模糊网络在严重模糊情况下表现不佳。

Method: 使用可投影运动模糊模型(PMBM)，通过神经网络预测完整3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的端到端恢复网络，并采用重模糊损失优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上均达到最先进性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现优于端到端去模糊网络。

Conclusion: 提出的模块化架构不仅提供可解释性（揭示相机运动轨迹），还能重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列，在复杂模糊场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Motivation: 消费级相机系统在复杂光照条件下（如低光、高动态范围、背光）难以保持稳定的图像质量，导致曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，影响下游视觉任务的性能。

Method: 框架包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO以缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子以改善色彩一致性。针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像管道中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下泛化良好。大量实验表明ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net无需依赖额外的图像增强模块，就能有效解决复杂光照条件下的图像质量问题，为消费级相机系统提供了一种高效的参数调整解决方案。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain

*Jiahao Meng,Xiangtai Li,Haochen Wang,Yue Tan,Tao Zhang,Lingdong Kong,Yunhai Tong,Anran Wang,Zhiyang Teng,Yujing Wang,Zhuochen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，通过整合显式时空证据到视频推理中，在V-STAR基准上实现了最先进的性能，将mAM提高了14.4%，mLGM提高了24.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理模型只生成文本推理轨迹，不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置。OpenAI-o3等模型引发了图像证据中心推理的广泛兴趣，但将其扩展到视频更具挑战性，需要在动态场景中进行联合时间跟踪和空间定位。

Method: 构建了两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k和STGR-RL-36k，包含精心构建的时间和空间标注；采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计多个专门奖励函数，共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准上实现最先进性能，mAM提高14.4%，mLGM提高24.2%；在VideoMME、WorldSense、VideoMMMU和TVGBench等广泛视频理解基准上观察到一致改进。

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video不仅提高了准确性，其生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenColorBench是首个针对文本到图像生成中颜色控制的综合基准测试，包含44K个颜色相关提示，覆盖400多种颜色，通过感知和自动评估揭示模型在精细颜色控制方面的真实能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在精细颜色可控性方面表现不佳，现有基准测试要么忽视颜色评估，要么依赖粗糙评估方法，缺乏对RGB值解释和人类期望对齐等关键能力的系统性评估。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11颜色系统构建基准测试，包含数值颜色等在其他基准中缺失的内容，通过44K个颜色聚焦提示进行感知和自动化评估。

Result: 对流行文本到图像模型的评估显示性能差异，揭示了模型对哪些颜色约定理解最好，并识别了失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench评估将指导精确颜色生成的改进，该基准将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于相似性原型的跨模态分割框架，通过原型学习和对比学习解决领域适应问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在领域转移时性能急剧下降，无监督领域适应旨在减少领域差距并避免新领域的高昂标注成本

Method: 在嵌入空间中学习类别原型，引入相似性约束使原型具有代表性且类别间可分离，使用字典存储不同图像的原型以解决类别缺失问题并实现原型对比学习

Result: 大量实验表明该方法优于其他最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的跨模态分割框架有效解决了领域适应问题

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: OnlineSplatter是一个在线前馈框架，无需相机位姿或深度先验，直接从RGB视频帧生成高质量的对象中心3D高斯表示，适用于自由移动物体的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目视频中自由移动物体重建的挑战，特别是在缺乏可靠位姿或深度线索以及物体任意运动的情况下。

Method: 使用第一帧作为锚点，通过密集高斯基元场逐步细化对象表示；核心是双键记忆模块，结合潜在外观-几何键和显式方向键，通过空间引导记忆读取和高效稀疏化机制处理自由移动物体。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的评估显示，OnlineSplatter显著优于最先进的免位姿重建基线方法，随着观察增加性能持续提升，同时保持恒定内存和运行时间。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了无需相机位姿、深度先验或捆绑优化的高质量自由移动物体重建，具有恒定计算成本的优势。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

*Yuan Sheng,Yanbin Hao,Chenxu Li,Shuo Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeViCES是一个无需训练、模型无关的语义-视觉共识证据选择框架，用于解决长视频理解中计算成本高和推理不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临复杂、多样且时间分散的内容挑战，现有视频大语言模型处理长序列时计算成本过高且推理不集中、不一致。现有帧选择方法忽略时间依赖或依赖单模态证据，无法提供完整且与查询相关的上下文。

Method: SeViCES包含两个关键组件：1) 语义-视觉共识帧选择模块(SVCFS)，通过时间感知语义分支和聚类引导视觉分支选择帧；2) 答案共识精炼模块(ACR)，通过融合证据和约束答案空间来解决语义和视觉预测间的不一致性。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES框架证明了其在长视频理解中的有效性。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: BTB3D是一种用于3D医学影像的因果卷积编码器-解码器模型，通过频率感知的体素标记化技术，在CT报告生成和文本到CT合成任务中实现了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理高分辨率、长序列3D医学影像时存在局限性：对比预训练导致视觉编码器与临床语言不匹配，切片级标记化模糊精细解剖结构，降低下游任务的诊断性能。

Method: 采用三阶段训练课程：局部重建、重叠窗口平铺和长上下文解码器精炼。模型从短切片片段学习，但能泛化到超过300个切片的扫描，无需额外内存开销。

Result: 在报告生成任务中，BLEU分数提升，临床F1分数比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成任务中，FID降低75%，FVD减半，生成解剖学一致的512*512*241体素体积。

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化对于3D医学影像中的可扩展视觉语言建模至关重要，而不仅仅是更大的语言骨干网络。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超高分辨率文本到图像生成面临两大挑战：缺乏大规模高质量数据集，以及忽视针对超高分辨率场景的精细细节合成训练策略。

Method: 1) 构建UltraHR-100K数据集，包含10万张3K+分辨率的图像；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则化(SWFR)。

Result: 在UltraHR-eval4K基准测试中，该方法显著提升了超高分辨率图像生成的精细细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据集和专门设计的训练策略，有效解决了超高分辨率文本到图像生成中的细节合成问题。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

Motivation: 现有多比特量化方法需要为每个比特宽度重复全数据集训练，训练成本随精度数量线性增长，且需要额外微调阶段，训练负担重。

Method: 1. 权重偏置校正：通过中和量化引起的偏置来共享批量归一化，无需微调；2. 比特级核心集采样：利用梯度重要性分数为每个子模型选择紧凑的信息子集进行训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的准确率同时，训练时间最多减少7.88倍。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了多比特量化网络的训练开销问题，在多个数据集和架构上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Conclusion: 未来视觉推理模型应专注于整合更多专门工具来分析视觉内容，将发布框架和评估套件促进研究。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation
suite to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: MixKV是一种针对大型视觉语言模型KV缓存压缩的新方法，通过结合重要性和多样性来优化压缩效果，在极端压缩条件下显著提升多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对来减少存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，导致语义覆盖不足。

Method: MixKV方法分析注意力头间的语义冗余差异，自适应地平衡重要性和多样性来选择性压缩KV对，而不是仅依赖重要性标准。

Result: 在极端压缩条件下（预算=64），MixKV平均提升基线方法5.1%，在GUI接地任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别提升8.0%和9.0%，同时保持可比的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过结合重要性和多样性有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩中的语义覆盖问题，在多个LVLM和LLM上均取得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息丢失，影响高保真应用的需求。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断LiDAR传感器的关键内在参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束校准校正，实现无损投影。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoScape是一个长时域驾驶场景生成框架，通过RGB-D扩散模型迭代生成稀疏几何一致的关键帧，然后使用视频扩散模型进行帧插值，生成超过20秒的几何一致驾驶视频。

Motivation: 解决长时域驾驶场景生成中的几何一致性问题，传统方法在长序列生成中难以保持几何一致性。

Method: 1) 在共享潜空间中联合处理图像和深度；2) 显式条件化先前生成关键帧的几何信息；3) 使用扭曲一致引导控制采样过程；4) 视频扩散模型进行关键帧插值。

Result: 生成超过20秒的逼真且几何一致的驾驶视频，长时域FID和FVD分数分别比现有最优方法提升48.6%和43.0%。

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和插值方法，有效解决了长时域驾驶场景生成的几何一致性问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Motivation: 扩散变换器在高分辨率图像生成时面临自注意力机制二次计算复杂度的挑战，训练成本极高。

Method: 利用扩散过程的光谱进展特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码的频率谱，使其与当前生成阶段匹配。

Conclusion: DyPE是一种有效的训练免费方法，能够显著扩展预训练扩散变换器的分辨率能力，实现16百万像素级别的图像生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

TL;DR: α-Flow通过解耦MeanFlow中的轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性冲突，采用课程学习策略从轨迹流匹配平滑过渡到MeanFlow，在ImageNet-1K 256x256上实现了最先进的生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MeanFlow目标函数自然分解为轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两个部分，这两个项存在强负相关性，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出α-Flow框架，统一了轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用课程学习策略平滑地从轨迹流匹配过渡到MeanFlow，解耦冲突目标。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上使用标准DiT骨干网络，α-Flow在所有规模和设置下均优于MeanFlow，α-Flow-XL/2+模型在1-NFE和2-NFE下分别达到2.58和2.15的FID分数，创下新记录。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦MeanFlow中的优化冲突，实现了更好的收敛性和生成性能，为少步生成建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: 解决从单张2D图像准确推断相机姿态、3D形状和纹理的挑战，将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，实现姿态和形状估计的统一生成框架。

Method: 采用两阶段流匹配：粗阶段生成初始3D几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复；精阶段集成姿态对齐图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Result: 在PSNR上获得超过3dB的提升，Chamfer距离减少超过10%，姿态精度与单目估计器相当，视觉保真度优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid通过统一的生成框架在单图像3D重建中实现了卓越的性能，在形状重建精度、姿态估计和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究往往低估雷达的作用，仅将其作为辅助传感器，而雷达实际上能够提供目标在世界3D坐标系中的精确距离/深度信息。本文旨在充分发挥雷达的关键作用。

Method: 1) 开发雷达-相机融合MOT框架，利用在线标定简化传感器检测结果集成；2) 利用雷达和相机数据的共同特征准确推导检测对象的真实世界位置；3) 采用特征匹配和类别一致性检查，超越单纯位置匹配的限制。

Result: 在受控环境和实际交通场景中的实验证明，该框架能够简化雷达-相机映射过程并提高跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究雷达-相机共同特征集成及其在在线标定中应用以实现多目标跟踪的工作，为传感器融合跟踪提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像分割集成到多模态大语言模型中时，通常使用边界点表示或专用分割头，这些方法依赖离散表示或语义提示，限制了MLLM捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 基于图像生成的分割框架，利用MLLM输出视觉标记，通过通用VQ-VAE将其解码为图像，使分割完全依赖于MLLM的像素级理解；采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成所需视觉标记以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越先前最先进方法，推理速度显著提升，同时保持强大的理解能力。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg通过图像生成范式成功实现了统一的多模态理解和像素级感知，为图像分割任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型的性能和可扩展性启发，本研究旨在将transformer架构应用于视频预测领域，特别关注物理模拟的时间因果建模这一现有视频生成方法的常见短板。

Method: 采用纯transformer模型进行自回归视频预测，使用连续像素空间表示，比较不同的时空自注意力布局，通过物理对象跟踪指标和无监督训练来隔离时空推理能力。

Result: 与现有的潜在空间方法相比，该方法将物理准确预测的时间范围显著延长了50%，同时在常见视频质量指标上保持可比性能。可解释性实验发现网络能够准确估计PDE模拟参数。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台，展示了transformer在视频预测领域的潜力。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在处理信息密集型图像时存在困难，这些图像密集交织文本注释和细粒度图形元素，主要挑战在于精确定位关键线索和整合分散证据的多跳推理。

Method: 采用训练免费的推测解码框架，包含草稿阶段和裁决阶段。草稿阶段使用小型VLM作为草稿专家生成多样化定位候选的推理路径；裁决阶段使用强大VLM合成这些路径生成最终答案，并引入共识专家选择机制仅转发高一致性推理路径。

Result: 在具有挑战性的信息密集和高分辨率视觉问答基准测试中取得一致提升，包括InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K。

Conclusion: 通过从多个部分准确的推理路径中合成正确见解，SV相比大型专有模型或训练流程实现了错误纠正和成本效率的平衡。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

TL;DR: SpectraMorph：一种基于物理引导的自监督高光谱-多光谱图像融合框架，通过解混瓶颈实现可解释的高光谱超分辨率重建，在单波段MSI下仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，且在MSI波段很少时容易失败。需要开发既能保持高性能又具有物理可解释性的融合方法。

Method: 采用解混瓶颈：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用紧凑MLP从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，使用MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行自监督训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线方法，与监督基线方法相比也非常有竞争力。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph提供可解释的中间结果，训练时间不到一分钟，即使在单波段MSI下也保持鲁棒性，为高光谱超分辨率提供了有效的物理引导解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Conclusion: LDDBM建立了一个强大的通用模态转换基准，支持任意模态对，为跨模态转换提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体个性化文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现空间组合控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多主体场景。

Method: 引入分层画布表示，每个主体位于独立层；使用锁定机制保持选定层的高保真度，同时让其他层灵活适应上下文。

Result: 实验表明LayerComposer在多主体个性化图像生成中实现了优于现有方法的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过分层表示和锁定机制，为多主体个性化图像生成提供了有效的交互控制解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的文本到视频模型擅长生成孤立片段，但在创建连贯的多镜头叙事方面存在不足，这限制了真正的故事讲述能力。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，同时使用稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集但镜头间稀疏）确保分钟级生成的效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆以及对电影技术的直观理解等新兴能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从片段合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

Method: DeEAR基于语音学和心理学，从情感、韵律和自发性三个维度评估语音表达性，使用不到500个标注样本就能实现与人类感知的强对齐。

Result: DeEAR与人类感知的Spearman等级相关系数达到0.86，不仅能可靠评分，还能进行公平基准测试和针对性数据筛选，显著提升了语音到语音模型的表达性分数。

Conclusion: DeEAR提供了一个有效的语音表达性评估框架，不仅能够准确评估现有模型的表达性差距，还能通过数据筛选显著提升模型的表达性表现。

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still
lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable
evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings,
low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or
incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive
Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech
expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology,
DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and
Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.
Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data
curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but
also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves
the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models.

### [150] [Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20728)
*Xi He,Sirui Lu,Bei Zeng*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体、人在环的工作流程，用于协同设计具有规定横向对角门的量子码。该流程基于SSLP框架，通过GPT-5驱动，在TeXRA平台上实现，包含三个角色：合成智能体、搜索智能体和审计智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在系统化地设计和验证具有特定横向对角门的量子码，将可行性问题转化为可扩展的分析流程，结合系统枚举和精确分析重建。

Method: 使用SSLP框架对基字符串进行模余分区，通过小型线性规划强制执行Z-边际Knill-Laflamme等式。在LaTeX-Python环境中，三个智能体协作：合成智能体制定问题，搜索智能体筛选候选并数值精确化，审计智能体独立验证所有KL等式和逻辑操作。

Result: 对于距离d=2和非退化余数的情况，在n≤6量子比特和码维度K∈{2,3,4}下，系统扫描生成了可实现的循环逻辑群的证书支持表。例如，K=3时在n=6处获得阶16。从已验证实例中抽象出闭式族，并证明它们对所有参数满足KL等式。

Conclusion: 该工作流程将横向对角可行性重新构建为可扩展的分析管道，结合系统枚举和精确分析重建，产生可复现的码构造，支持扩展到更大的K和更高距离，并导向数据驱动的分类。

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum
codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum
Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis
strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)
equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented
within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that
supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow
reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,
edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.
Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates
the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics
into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and
the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with
nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits,
systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic
logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$
at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring
structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities
for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue
degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal
controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts
diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,
combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It
yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger
$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

TL;DR: C2C是一个可扩展的多智能体LLM协作框架，通过Alignment Factor度量和Sequential Action Framework，在复杂任务中实现智能通信决策，将任务完成时间减少约40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体LLM系统缺乏面向任务的系统化通信框架，无法有效支持复杂任务中的多样化通信策略。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：(1) Alignment Factor - 量化智能体任务对齐度的新指标；(2) Sequential Action Framework - 将逐步执行与智能通信决策相结合。

Result: 在5-17个智能体的现实编码工作流中，C2C相比无通信和固定步骤基线，将任务完成时间减少约40%，且通信成本可接受，所有任务在标准配置下成功完成。

Conclusion: C2C为多智能体系统中的通信有效性测量建立了理论基础，并为复杂协作任务提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication
strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for
task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a
scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that
directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that
integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C
enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving
task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic
coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17
agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The
results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with
acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully
in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C
establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication
effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex
collaborative tasks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了电子表格操作文档化(SOD)任务，构建了包含111个代码片段及其自然语言摘要的基准，评估了5个LLM在生成电子表格文档方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格在商业和金融领域广泛使用，但缺乏系统化文档方法阻碍了自动化、协作和知识传递，导致关键机构知识流失的风险。

Method: 创建包含111个电子表格操作代码片段及其对应自然语言摘要的基准数据集，使用GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini、LLaMA-3.3-70B、Mixtral-8x7B和Gemma2-9B五个LLM，采用BLEU、GLEU、ROUGE-L和METEOR指标进行评估。

Result: 研究结果表明LLM能够生成准确的电子表格文档，使SOD成为增强电子表格可重现性、可维护性和协作工作流程的可行前提步骤。

Conclusion: LLM可以有效生成电子表格操作文档，但仍有需要解决的挑战，SOD为实现更好的电子表格管理和协作提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

*Adam Diamant*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 开发AI姿态估计管道，量化阻力训练中的运动学参数，比较部分范围运动(pROM)和全范围运动(fROM)训练在运动范围、节奏和执行动态方面的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用AI技术精确量化阻力训练中的运动学参数，比较不同训练方式(pROM vs fROM)的执行特征，为阻力训练处方提供科学依据。

Method: 使用Wolf等人(2025)的视频数据，处理280个记录提取关节角度轨迹，计算运动范围、节奏、向心/离心相持续时间等指标，应用随机效应元分析模型。

Result: pROM训练具有更小的运动范围和更短的总持续时间，特别是离心阶段；参与者个体差异是变异主要来源；新指标%ROM显示部分训练在不同练习中保持相对一致。

Conclusion: 部分范围训练不仅在运动范围上不同于全范围训练，在执行动态和一致性方面也存在差异，AI方法有潜力推动阻力训练研究和处方改进。

Abstract: This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise
quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data
from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full
range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26
participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle
trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,
including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase
durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for
within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM
repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,
particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed
that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were
the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of
heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which
is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this
definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across
exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from
full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and
consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing
research and improving resistance training prescription.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GUSL-Dehaze是一种轻量级的图像去雾方法，结合物理模型和绿色学习框架，避免使用深度学习，在保持性能的同时显著减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的去雾方法计算成本高、参数规模大，不适合资源受限设备。需要一种轻量级、透明的替代方案。

Method: 使用改进的暗通道先验进行初始去雾，然后通过U形架构实现绿色学习流程，包括无监督表示学习和特征工程技术，最后通过透明监督学习获得去雾图像。

Result: GUSL-Dehaze显著减少了参数数量，同时保持了与最先进深度学习模型相当的性能，并确保数学可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像去雾提供了一种轻量级、透明的绿色学习替代方案，适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from
a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the
physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image.
While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning
architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large
parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In
this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image
dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning
(GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional
deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze
completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing
step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green
learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This
architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature
extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant
Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a
compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent
supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count
while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par
with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

challenges such as cross-modal alignment, latency-accuracy tradeoffs, and
semantic grounding, and outline open problems and future research directions

Abstract: This study presents the multilingual e-commerce search system developed by
the Tredence_AICOE team. The competition features two multilingual relevance
tasks: Query-Category (QC) Relevance, which evaluates how well a user's search
query aligns with a product category, and Query-Item (QI) Relevance, which
measures the match between a multilingual search query and an individual
product listing. To ensure full language coverage, we performed data
augmentation by translating existing datasets into languages missing from the
development set, enabling training across all target languages. We fine-tuned
Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B model for both tasks using multiple strategies.
The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决早期现代宗教图像分类的挑战，传统图像和基于关键词的搜索方法在精度上存在局限，需要更准确的大规模视觉档案分析工具。

Method: 利用神圣罗马帝国书籍插图的全页上下文，通过LLM生成包含视觉和文本元素的详细描述，然后通过混合向量搜索匹配相关的Iconclass代码。

Result: 在五个和四个分类级别上分别达到87%和92%的精确度，显著优于传统图像和基于关键词的搜索方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLMs和RAG在艺术史和数字人文学科研究中的巨大潜力，为大规模视觉档案分析提供了强大工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern
religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in
combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages
the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,
allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual
and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass
codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%
precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly
outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing
full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,
offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual
archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of
LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

TL;DR: 研究探讨人类与LLM在争议话题多轮对话中的双向影响，发现人类观点变化很小而LLM输出变化显著，个性化设置会放大这种变化，个人故事交流最容易引发双方立场改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM对用户的单向影响，缺乏对人类输入如何影响LLM响应以及双向影响在多轮对话中如何表现的研究。

Method: 通过50个争议话题讨论，266名参与者分为三组：静态陈述、标准聊天机器人和个性化聊天机器人，分析多轮对话中的双向影响。

Result: 人类观点几乎没有变化，而LLM输出变化显著，缩小了人类与LLM立场差距。个性化设置双向放大变化，个人故事交流最易触发双方立场改变。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人机交互中过度对齐的风险，需要更谨慎地设计个性化聊天机器人以更稳定地与用户对齐。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion
exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work
extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM
responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the
multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50
controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three
conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.
Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more
substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization
amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.
Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving
participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for
both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in
human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots
to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Empathic Prompting是一个新颖的多模态人机交互框架，通过集成面部表情识别服务，将用户的非语言情感线索作为上下文信号嵌入到大型语言模型的对话中，实现更自然的交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态界面需要显式用户控制，无法充分利用非语言情感线索。在医疗、教育等领域，用户的情感信号对沟通至关重要，但在语言交流中往往难以捕捉。

Method: 采用模块化架构，集成商业面部表情识别服务，通过本地部署的DeepSeek实例实现系统设计，将情感线索作为上下文信号嵌入提示中。

Result: 初步评估（N=5）显示系统能一致地将非语言输入整合到连贯的LLM输出中，参与者强调对话流畅性得到改善。

Conclusion: Empathic Prompting为聊天机器人介导的通信提供了有前景的应用方向，特别是在需要捕捉用户情感信号的关键领域。

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

TL;DR: RLEV方法通过将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，使大语言模型优化与可量化的人类价值信号对齐，超越仅基于正确性的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法虽然能有效训练模型，但忽略了不同任务的重要性差异。RLEV旨在解决这一问题，让模型优化直接与人类价值优先级对齐。

Method: 使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，通过价值加权梯度放大机制实现价值敏感的策略学习。

Result: RLEV在多个RL算法和模型规模上持续优于仅基于正确性的基线方法，不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学会了价值敏感的终止策略。

Conclusion: RLEV为将LLM与人类优先级对齐提供了一条实用路径，即使在噪声价值信号下也保持稳健，表明优化显式效用函数是实现价值对齐的有效方法。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个系统化评估LLM代理利用测试用例倾向的基准框架，通过创建自然语言规范与单元测试冲突的"不可能"任务来测量作弊率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找和利用"捷径"完成任务，这种行为会破坏基准测试的有效性和实际部署的可靠性，需要量化、研究和缓解。

Method: 从现有基准创建"不可能"任务变体，引入自然语言规范与单元测试的直接冲突，测量代理在这些任务上的通过率作为作弊率。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂运算符重载的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环如何影响作弊率。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench不仅是评估工具，还是研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具的多功能框架，有助于构建更健壮的LLM系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于相对排序的概率（RBP）指标和相对排序缩放定律，从相对排序角度补充了传统基于交叉熵的缩放定律，为语言模型缩放提供了更全面的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究几乎完全依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只衡量了正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序关系，而相对排序对于语言模型（如贪婪采样场景）至关重要。

Method: 首先提出相对排序概率（RBP）指标，量化正确token在top预测中的排名概率；基于此建立相对排序缩放定律，描述RBP如何随模型规模增加而改进；在四个数据集和四个模型家族上进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 通过跨越五个数量级的实验，证明了该定律的鲁棒性和准确性；展示了该定律的两个应用示例：为涌现现象提供更深层解释，以及促进寻找缩放定律的基本理论。

Conclusion: 相对排序缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大规模语言模型缩放提供了更完整的理解，对实际开发和理论探索都具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

### [163] [BadGraph: A Backdoor Attack Against Latent Diffusion Model for Text-Guided Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20792)
*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph是针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，使用文本触发器毒化训练数据，在推理时植入攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图生成的快速发展带来了新的安全担忧，特别是后门漏洞。虽然先前工作探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但条件性（尤其是文本引导）图生成仍未被充分研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器毒化训练数据，在VAE和扩散训练期间隐蔽地植入后门，当触发器出现时在推理过程中诱导攻击者指定的子图。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明攻击有效且隐蔽：不到10%的毒化率可达50%攻击成功率，24%毒化率可达80%以上成功率，对良性样本性能影响可忽略。消融研究显示后门是在VAE和扩散训练期间植入的。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，凸显了在药物发现等模型应用中的严重风险，并强调需要对此类扩散模型中的后门攻击进行鲁棒防御。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速且无需微调的LLM适应方法，通过选择性矩阵降维和梯度分析来提升下游任务准确率，仅需100个样本和单次梯度计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LASER方法中逐层搜索和全数据集前向传播带来的高计算开销问题，使LLM适应下游任务更加高效实用。

Method: 使用梯度分析识别关键矩阵，允许矩阵行在多个子空间聚类并分别分解，仅需100个样本计算梯度和评估准确率。

Result: 方法将准确率提升高达24.6个百分点，显著减少搜索时间，实现快速LLM适应。

Conclusion: 结合梯度分析和选择性降维，可在无需微调的情况下快速适应LLM到新数据集，仅需少量样本和计算资源。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿。现有方法在处理这类数据时面临挑战，需要能够有效处理随机性的新框架。

Method: FINDER将数据集视为随机场的实现，通过映射到希尔伯特空间构建随机特征，使用Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开分解为可计算的不可约分量，通过特征分解实现分类。

Result: 在多个数据稀缺的科学领域验证，在阿尔茨海默症分期分类和遥感森林砍伐检测中取得了最先进的突破性成果。

Conclusion: FINDER通过将随机分析思想融入特征学习和推理阶段，为噪声数据集提供了有效的分类解决方案，并讨论了其适用条件和局限性。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全解耦的训练策略来解决原型自监督学习中的原型坍塌问题，通过将原型和编码器分别在不同目标下学习，消除了原型坍塌并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在部分原型坍塌问题，即多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这削弱了提供多样化和信息丰富目标的核心目的。现有方法通常过度参数化原型集或添加临时正则化器，但只缓解症状而未解决根本原因。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器在分离的目标下学习。具体来说，将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格过程更新，独立于编码器的损失函数。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型坍塌，无需显式正则化，产生了持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型坍塌的根本原因，提供了一种更有效的自监督学习框架。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于商业飞行模拟器的图像生成方法，用于跑道检测任务，通过结合少量真实图像和大量合成图像来训练目标检测模型，并采用定制化的域适应策略提高模型在夜间等恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶导航等关键应用中，训练深度视觉模型需要大量标注数据，成本高昂且难以覆盖所有可能场景，特别是罕见情况。合成图像生成是解决这一问题的有前景方案，但需要缓解合成到真实的分布偏移问题。

Method: 使用商业飞行模拟器生成合成图像，结合少量真实标注图像，通过控制图像生成过程和真实/合成数据的整合，训练标准目标检测模型，并采用定制化的域适应策略。

Result: 标准目标检测模型能够实现准确的预测，在未在真实数据中出现的夜间图像等恶劣条件下也表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于飞行模拟器的图像生成方法能够有效补充真实数据，结合定制化域适应策略可以显著提高模型在关键应用中的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的激增，水印技术对确保内容真实性和归属至关重要。然而，水印伪造（从真实内容窃取水印并应用于恶意内容）这一场景尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 1. 引入基于排序损失的偏好模型来检测图像是否含水印，仅使用程序生成的图像进行训练；2. 通过反向传播优化输入图像来移除和伪造水印，仅需单张水印图像且无需了解水印模型。

Result: 在多种后处理图像水印模型上的评估表明，该方法能有效伪造水印，证明当前水印方法存在安全风险。

Conclusion: 提出的水印伪造方法简单实用，对现有水印技术的安全性提出了质疑，代码和资源已公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

TL;DR: MEIcoder是一种生物信息解码方法，利用神经元特异性最兴奋输入(MEIs)、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，在小数据集上实现从V1区单细胞活动重建视觉刺激的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵长类或人类等生物数据稀缺，高吞吐量记录技术难以应用，这给深度学习解码技术带来挑战，需要开发在少量数据下仍能有效工作的解码方法。

Method: 提出MEIcoder方法，结合神经元特异性MEIs、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，构建生物信息解码框架。

Result: 在V1区单细胞活动重建视觉刺激任务中达到最先进性能，特别是在神经元记录较少的小数据集上表现优异，仅需1,000-2,500个神经元和不到1,000个训练样本即可重建高保真自然图像。

Conclusion: 证明了在早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解，并提出了包含16万样本的统一基准以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

TL;DR: Prompt Decorators是一个声明式、可组合的语法框架，通过紧凑的控制令牌（如+++Reasoning, +++Tone）来管理LLM行为，将任务意图与执行行为解耦，提高提示设计的可重用性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示工程依赖冗长的自然语言指令，限制了可重现性、模块化和可解释性。用户缺乏对LLM推理和输出表达方式的一致控制。

Method: 提出Prompt Decorators框架，包含20个核心装饰器，分为认知与生成、表达与系统两个功能家族。定义统一语法、作用域模型和确定性处理流水线。

Result: 演示用例显示提高了推理透明度、减少了提示复杂性，并实现了跨领域的标准化模型行为。

Conclusion: 该框架对互操作性、行为一致性以及可扩展AI系统的声明式接口开发具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and
decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they
reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose
natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and
interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,
composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such
as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems
Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning
style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework
formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families
(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed
into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and
session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic
processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By
decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a
reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases
demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and
standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with
implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development
of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的LLM网页代理框架，为开放网页环境中的实际具身推理迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续预训练方法需要访问原始基础模型或依赖外部领域知识库，这在基础模型权重被保留或可靠外部语料不可用时存在现实障碍。

Method: IKnow框架在指令-响应对话格式中制定新的自监督目标，利用文本本身嵌入的领域知识，在更深语义层面进行编码学习。

Result: 该方法能够在不依赖外部资源的情况下，保持模型的指令跟随能力，同时适应新的领域。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一个简单通用的框架，解决了持续预训练中指令能力退化的问题，无需外部依赖。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型主要关注最终答案正确性，这种方法过于粗糙，忽略了推理过程的质量，无法有效指导模型改进。

Method: 引入CaSE方法，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，使用前向上下文评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准上验证了CaSE与人类判断的一致性，并证明使用CaSE评估的数据进行训练能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE提供了一个可扩展的框架来分析、调试和改进LLM推理，展示了超越简单有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

### [177] [Kinaema: a recurrent sequence model for memory and pose in motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20261)
*Mert Bulent Sariyildiz,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Guillaume Bono,Gianluca Monaci,Christian Wolf*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出Kinaema模型，通过隐式潜在记忆处理视觉观测流，实现机器人在大场景中的定位和导航，无需显式存储观测历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在连续操作中利用先前观察信息进行高效定位的问题，实现"找到方向"的能力。

Method: 使用基于transformer的循环模型维护隐式潜在记忆，压缩传感器读数历史为紧凑表示，处理查询图像并预测相对位置。

Result: 模型能有效维护场景表示，导航到在episode开始前观察到的目标，计算效率优于传统基于观测历史注意力的transformer。

Conclusion: Kinaema模型通过隐式记忆机制实现了高效的大场景定位和导航，突破了传统方法的上下文长度限制。

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

### [178] [Dino-Diffusion Modular Designs Bridge the Cross-Domain Gap in Autonomous Parking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20335)
*Zixuan Wu,Hengyuan Zhang,Ting-Hsuan Chen,Yuliang Guo,David Paz,Xinyu Huang,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP)方法，结合视觉基础模型和扩散规划，实现领域无关的自动驾驶停车，在领域偏移下保持90%以上的停车成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端自动驾驶方法在领域偏移（如天气和光照变化）下的鲁棒性问题，不依赖额外数据。

Method: 集成视觉基础模型与基于扩散的运动规划，在CARLA中训练并在对抗性设置下进行零样本迁移。

Result: 在所有测试的分布外场景中停车成功率超过90%，在3D高斯溅射重建的真实停车场中显示出有前景的仿真到真实迁移能力。

Conclusion: DDP通过架构和算法设计显著提升了跨领域性能，为自动驾驶停车提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real
policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering
of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian
Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with
robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we
curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data
collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual
reinforcement learning. Website: https://3dgsworld.github.io/.
