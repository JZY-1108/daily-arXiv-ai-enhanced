Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出自动归因方法，将摘要中的每个句子链接到源文本的特定部分，使用混合摘要（自动改写提取式摘要）来简化归因过程，并通过定制拓扑识别归因相关错误的比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析师需要归因，因为不知道信息来源就无法进行报告。自动归因方法对于将摘要句子与源文本关联至关重要。

Method: 采用混合摘要方法（自动改写提取式摘要）来简化归因，并使用定制拓扑来识别不同类别归因相关错误的比例。

Result: 开发了自动归因方法，能够将摘要句子链接到源文本的特定部分，并识别归因错误类别。

Conclusion: 混合摘要方法有助于简化归因过程，定制拓扑能够有效识别归因相关错误，为自动归因提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

### [2] [GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590)
*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异构图学习的个性化LLM路由框架，通过四类节点（用户、LLM、查询、响应）建模多轮交互，在少样本数据下有效学习用户偏好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法缺乏完全个性化，无法捕捉用户与LLM的复杂交互，且用户偏好数据通常稀缺、嘈杂、格式不一致

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互表示为异构图，通过定制化的消息传递机制在轻量级归纳图学习框架中从少样本数据学习用户偏好

Result: 在多个数据集上准确率提升0.9-21.6%，AUC提升0.006-0.309，能适应新用户和演化偏好而无需大量微调

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过图学习方法有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化问题，在少样本场景下表现出色

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

*Azza Bouleimen,Giordano De Marzo,Taehee Kim,Nicol`o Pagan,Hannah Metzler,Silvia Giordano,David Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明大型语言模型能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话，人类参与者有39%的时间会将AI生成的内容误认为人类创作，特别是在Llama 3生成的对话中，识别准确率仅56%，略高于随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型模拟社交媒体群组对话的有效性，探索其在内容推荐算法测试和内容政策影响评估等应用中的潜力。

Method: 从Reddit收集真实人类对话，使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o在同一话题上生成人工对话，通过参与者对并排展示的对话进行人类/AI识别测试。

Result: LLM生成的对话被误认为人类创作的比例达39%，其中Llama 3生成的对话被正确识别为AI的准确率仅56%，略高于随机猜测水平。

Conclusion: LLM能够生成足以欺骗人类的社交媒体对话，既展示了社会模拟的潜力，也警示了LLM可能被滥用于生成不真实社交媒体内容的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

### [4] [Knowledge Graph Analysis of Legal Understanding and Violations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08593)
*Abha Jha,Abel Salinas,Fred Morstatter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在法律分析中的双重性：既能解读复杂法律条款，又存在生成危险内容的安全漏洞。通过知识图谱和RAG方法评估LLMs对生物武器法律的理解能力、意图判断和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在法律领域具有变革潜力，但存在安全隐患——能够分析法律条款的同时也可能生成危险指令。需要系统评估其在敏感法律领域的表现。

Method: 结合知识图谱构建和检索增强生成(RAG)技术，通过结构化实验评估LLMs的法律理解能力、意图判断准确性以及安全机制的有效性。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在法律推理和安全机制方面存在显著局限性，但通过增强安全协议和强化法律推理框架可以改善。

Conclusion: 通过结合增强的安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架，可以开发出能够安全协助敏感法律领域的LLMs，确保其成为法律的守护者而非无意中的违反者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

### [5] [Diverse Preference Learning for Capabilities and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08594)
*Stewart Slocum,Asher Parker-Sartori,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Soft Preference Learning方法来解决对齐算法导致的LLM输出多样性下降问题，通过解耦KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，实现对生成多样性的精细控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐算法（如RLHF和DPO）显著降低了LLM输出的多样性，导致模型生成重复结构、统一思维方式，并反映更窄的社会观点范围。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法，解构KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，允许对LLM生成多样性进行精细控制。

Result: 从能力角度看，使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在困难重复采样任务上获得更高准确率，产生更大语义和词汇多样性输出；从对齐角度看，能代表更广泛社会观点并改善logit校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是对标准温度缩放的帕累托改进，能有效平衡对齐目标与输出多样性需求。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

### [6] [Chopping Trees: Semantic Similarity Based Dynamic Pruning for Tree-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08595)
*Joongho Kim,Xirui Huang,Zarreen Reza,Gabriel Grand,Kevin Zhu,Ryan Lagasse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSDP是一种轻量级方法，通过在线语义合并和动态剪枝来减少Tree-of-Thought推理中的语义冗余，在保持竞争力的准确性的同时实现高达2.3倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-of-Thought推理虽然提升了LLM的问题解决能力，但由于语义冗余导致计算成本高昂，需要更高效的推理方法。

Method: 提出语义相似性动态剪枝(SSDP)，将在线语义合并集成到并行树搜索中，实时聚类和剪枝冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500等推理基准测试中，SSDP相比最先进的树搜索基线实现2.3倍加速，探索节点数减少85-90%，准确率保持在最强基线的5%以内。

Conclusion: SSDP为高效、可扩展的LLM推理提供了一种实用方法，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

### [7] [What About the Scene with the Hitler Reference? HAUNT: A Framework to Probe LLMs' Self-consistency Via Adversarial Nudge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08596)
*Arka Dutta,Sujan Dutta,Rijul Magu,Soumyajit Datta,Munmun De Choudhury,Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个对抗性压力测试框架，用于评估大语言模型在事实保真度方面的鲁棒性，发现不同模型在对抗性提示下的表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题是LLM在实际部署中的关键挑战，特别是在高风险领域需要测试模型在对抗性提示下的事实保真度。

Method: 三步框架：1) 让LLM生成特定领域内的真相和谎言；2) 让LLM验证这些断言；3) 测试LLM对自身生成谎言的鲁棒性。

Result: 五个主流专有LLM在电影和小说两个封闭领域测试中表现出不同的脆弱性：Claude最强韧，GPT和Grok中等，Gemini和DeepSeek最弱。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多人使用LLM进行信息检索，研究结果敲响了警钟，表明需要提高模型对对抗性提示的抵抗力。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

### [8] [Self-HarmLLM: Can Large Language Model Harm Itself?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08597)
*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-HarmLLM攻击场景，使用同一模型生成的Mitigated Harmful Query作为新输入，验证了在GPT-3.5-turbo等模型上可达65%转换成功率和41%越狱成功率，发现自动评估会高估越狱成功率52%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御假设外部攻击者制作有害查询，未充分探索模型自身输出成为新攻击向量的可能性。

Method: 使用同一模型生成的Mitigated Harmful Query作为新输入，在GPT-3.5-turbo、LLaMA3-8B-instruct和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B上进行实验，采用Base、Zero-shot和Few-shot条件。

Result: Zero-shot条件下转换成功率最高52%，越狱成功率最高33%；Few-shot条件下转换成功率最高65%，越狱成功率最高41%。自动评估平均高估越狱成功率52%。

Conclusion: 证明了该方法可作为有效攻击场景，需要对护栏设计进行根本性重新考虑，并建立更稳健的评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

### [9] [OKBench: Democratizing LLM Evaluation with Fully Automated, On-Demand, Open Knowledge Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08598)
*Yanhong Li,Tianyang Xu,Kenan Tang,Karen Livescu,David McAllester,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OKBench是一个完全自动化的框架，用于按需生成高质量、动态的知识基准，特别关注新闻领域，通过智能代理自动化基准的获取、创建、验证和分发过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态基准无法捕捉动态世界中的知识演变，且集中式管理难以跟上LLM的快速发展步伐。

Method: 提出OKBench框架，采用智能代理自动化基准生成流程，减少与预训练数据的重叠，促进检索增强方法的全面评估。

Result: 评估结果显示不同模型在面对新信息时表现出明显差异，检索显著缩小了大小模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 在演化知识基准上评估LLM至关重要，OKBench为动态知识评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

### [10] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Pediatric Speech-Language Pathology vignettes: A Proof-of-Concept Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08600)
*Yilan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的系统，用于自动生成儿科言语语言病理学临床案例，解决了传统手动创建耗时且通用大语言模型缺乏领域知识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床案例是言语语言病理学教育的重要工具，但手动创建耗时费力。通用大语言模型虽然能生成文本，但缺乏领域专业知识，容易产生幻觉内容且需要大量专家修订。

Method: 构建了多模型RAG系统，整合了精选的领域知识库和工程化提示模板，支持5个商业和开源大语言模型，设计了7个涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景。

Result: 概念验证表明RAG增强生成儿科SLP案例在技术上可行。商业模型质量略有优势，但开源替代方案也达到可接受性能，适合隐私保护的机构部署。整合知识库使生成内容符合专业指南。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了自动生成儿科SLP临床案例的技术可行性，未来可扩展到临床决策支持、自动IEP目标生成和临床反思训练等应用，但需通过专家评审、学生试点测试和心理测量评估进行广泛验证。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

### [11] [Evaluating DisCoCirc in Translation Tasks & its Limitations: A Comparative Study Between Bengali & English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08601)
*Nazmoon Falgunee Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 将DisCoCirc形式化框架从英语扩展到孟加拉语，用于英孟翻译任务，发现该框架在语言结构差异下存在局限性，与先前研究结论不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展DisCoCirc框架到孟加拉语，重新评估其在减少语言官僚主义方面的有效性，检验先前关于该框架优越性的主张。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc的语法规则和电路表示方法，构建孟加拉语的形式化框架，应用于英孟翻译任务，并分析语言结构差异带来的挑战。

Result: DisCoCirc框架虽然适用于大部分语言内容，但在处理英孟语言结构差异时表现有限，即使是简单句子也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc在翻译任务中存在局限性，特别是在处理语言结构差异时，这为未来改进提供了方向，同时揭示了连词与布尔逻辑之间的联系。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Motivation: 孟加拉国低收入人群因法律语言复杂、程序不透明和高成本而难以获得负担得起的法律咨询，现有AI法律助手缺乏孟加拉语支持和本地化适配。

Method: 采用多语言嵌入和基于RAG的工具链框架，实现检索、推理、翻译和文档生成功能，通过交互式聊天界面提供情境感知的法律草案、引用和平白语言解释。

Result: 在2022和2023年孟加拉律师资格考试的所有阶段评估中，Mina在初步选择题、笔试和模拟口试中获得75-80%的分数，匹配或超过人类平均表现。

Conclusion: Mina证明了作为低成本多语言AI助手的潜力，能够自动化关键法律任务并扩大司法可及性，为构建领域特定、低资源系统提供了现实案例研究。

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗决策支持系统中日益重要，LLM在急诊医学诊断中的潜力尚未充分挖掘，需要评估不同LLM的诊断能力并探索集成方法提升准确率。

Method: 使用五种主流LLM（Gemini、Llama、Grok、GPT、Claude）处理真实急诊病例，构建MEDAS超级学习器，通过元学习器整合各LLM的不同能力，利用集体知识提升诊断准确性。

Result: 单个LLM诊断准确率在58%-65%之间，超过人类医生报告准确率；集成后的MEDAS系统准确率达到70%，其中最佳单个模型在集成环境中可达85%准确率。

Conclusion: 元学习方法整合的LLM集群能够超越任何单个模型的诊断能力，超级学习器可以利用多个LLM训练数据集的集体知识，显著提升急诊医学诊断准确率。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

Conclusion: GrADS方法在LLM领域专业化微调中具有显著效率和成本效益，能够用少量数据达到更好效果并保持通用能力。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Motivation: 自杀是青少年第二大死因，过去自杀企图是未来自杀的重要预测因素。许多有自杀想法的人在社交媒体上发出信号，需要有效识别这些模式。

Method: 结合CNN架构和BiGRU技术的混合深度学习方案，集成CNN局部特征提取、BiGRU双向序列建模、注意力机制和SHAP可解释性。

Result: 在公开数据集上达到93.97%的准确率，与现有最先进的机器学习和深度学习模型相比表现出优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合深度学习框架为自杀检测提供了全面解决方案，在准确性和可解释性方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

TL;DR: SAGE-Agent通过结构化不确定性建模工具调用参数，使用POMDP和EVPI目标优化问题选择，在模糊任务中提升覆盖率7-39%，同时减少澄清问题1.5-2.7倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在工具调用时，模糊的用户指令常导致错误调用和任务失败，需要更有效的澄清机制

Method: 提出工具调用参数的结构化不确定性建模，将联合工具-参数澄清建模为POMDP，使用EVPI目标进行最优问题选择，采用基于方面的成本建模防止冗余

Result: 在ClarifyBench基准测试中，SAGE-Agent在模糊任务上覆盖率提升7-39%，澄清问题减少1.5-2.7倍；结构化不确定性还提升了强化学习训练效果，When2Call准确率从36.5%提升至65.2%(3B模型)

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性为工具增强代理提供了原则性、高效的方法，在现实场景中同时提升了任务成功率和交互效率

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者自述中自动识别认知过程类别。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型表现最佳，在复杂认知类别提取方面优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者日常生活中的认知体验描述，可以为疾病相关的认知和情感变化提供重要见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种NLP模型：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct指令跟随模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini模型。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高F1分数（微平均0.74，宏平均0.59），在上下文依赖类别如思维和社交互动方面表现突出。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 尽管由于认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠性质，这项任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性，但通过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的认知功能纵向监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实对话中任务导向对话和闲聊模式会自然转换，但现有对话系统缺乏统一这两种模式的能力

Method: 构建TACT数据集支持用户和代理驱动的模式转换，提出Switch和Recovery评估指标，使用DPO优化训练

Result: TACT训练模型在意图检测和模式转换处理上优于基线，DPO进一步提升了性能，在人类评估中对GPT-4o达到70.1%胜率

Conclusion: 结构多样化的数据与DPO结合能显著提升对话响应质量和转换控制能力，推动更主动和转换感知的对话代理发展

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Motivation: 传统生物医学假设生成方法依赖单一数据类型或预定义提取模式，限制了发现新颖复杂关系的能力。LLM代理在信息检索、推理和生成方面有潜力，但缺乏标准化数据集和执行环境。

Method: 开发BioVerge基准测试和BioVerge Agent框架，使用ReAct方法，包含生成和评估模块，迭代产生和自评估假设提案，结合历史生物医学假设和PubMed文献的结构化和文本数据。

Result: 实验发现：1）不同代理架构影响探索多样性和推理策略；2）结构化和文本信息源各自提供独特关键上下文；3）自评估显著提高假设的新颖性和相关性。

Conclusion: BioVerge为生物医学假设生成提供了标准化环境，证明了LLM代理在该领域的有效性，特别是自评估机制和多样化信息源的重要性。

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了LLM生成参考文献时的幻觉问题，发现引用次数与事实准确性强相关，超过约1000次引用的文献几乎被逐字记忆，而高度引用论文间的内容相似性会导致记忆干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在引用推荐中常产生不存在论文的幻觉问题，本研究假设LLM正确生成参考文献的能力取决于其底层知识是生成还是记忆的，高引用论文在预训练语料中出现更频繁，幻觉率更低。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个跨20个计算机科学领域的引用，通过手动验证和计算生成与真实元数据间的余弦相似度来衡量事实一致性，将引用次数作为训练数据冗余的代理指标。

Result: 结果显示：(i)引用次数与事实准确性强相关；(ii)超过约1000次引用的文献信息几乎被逐字记忆；(iii)当多个高引用论文内容相似时会发生记忆干扰。

Conclusion: 研究发现了一个从泛化转向记忆的阈值，高引用论文几乎被逐字保留在模型中，这为理解LLM的知识表示机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Motivation: 大语言模型在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但经常产生幻觉内容，影响了事实可靠性，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 采用推理增强范式，将过程分解为规划、执行和修订三个阶段来识别和精炼无根据的主张，使用最小任务路由提示实现零样本泛化，不依赖外部知识源或监督检测器。

Result: 在五个代表性任务上的实验表明，HalluClean显著提高了事实一致性，并优于竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: HalluClean有潜力增强大语言模型输出在现实应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决现有方法无法平衡扩散模型并行生成优势与自回归模型质量优势的问题，寻求在保持高质量的同时实现高GPU利用率和吞吐量

Method: 使用结构化注意力掩码，在单次前向传播中先用扩散模型草稿生成，再用自回归模型采样，支持精确KV缓存

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模上，TiDAR在吞吐量上超越推测解码，在效率和质量上超越Dream和Llada等扩散模型，首次实现与AR模型质量相当的同时提供4.71-5.91倍令牌/秒

Conclusion: TiDAR成功平衡了并行生成效率与自回归质量，是首个在保持AR级别质量的同时显著提升吞吐量的架构

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

Method: 提出EVADE框架，使用大语言模型生成和验证解释来检测错误，通过分布比较、验证重叠和微调影响进行综合分析

Result: LLM验证使生成解释分布更接近人工标注，从训练数据中移除LLM检测的错误比移除人工检测的错误带来更大的微调性能提升

Conclusion: LLM方法可扩展错误检测规模，在减少人工努力的同时提高标签变异下的数据集质量

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Conclusion: SpiralThinker桥接了迭代计算和潜在推理，证明对齐的迭代更新可以在潜在空间中可靠地引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型情感支持评估多依赖短对话和静态快照，无法捕捉情感支持的动态性和长期性，需要更贴近真实交互场景的评估方法。

Method: 构建包含328个情感情境和1152个干扰事件的大规模基准，约束模型使用验证的情绪调节策略，将用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，并应用因果调整的情感估计。

Result: 提出了三个轨迹级指标（BEL、ETV、ECP）来捕捉用户情感动态，对不同LLMs的广泛评估揭示了情感支持能力的显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLMs的长期情感支持能力提供了全面评估，并为模型开发提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Motivation: 解决LLM在受监管行业（如金融和医疗）中应用的局限性，这些行业需要严格遵守政策，但LLM的固有随机性限制了其采用。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）使用LLM（可选人工指导）将自然语言政策形式化；2）推理时自动形式化验证自然语言陈述的逻辑正确性，必要时进行多重冗余形式化步骤交叉检查语义等价性。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了藏语流式语音识别中的上下文截断问题，在保持低延迟的同时实现了接近非流式识别的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

*Ritsu Sakabe,Hwichan Kim,Tosho Hirasawa,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估LLMs的幽默能力，发现LLMs在生成幽默回应方面达到中低水平人类表现，但在共情能力上存在明显缺陷，且与人类在幽默评估标准上存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLMs幽默能力的评估过于单一，仅关注是否"有趣"，缺乏多维度理解。本文旨在通过Oogiri这种日本即兴喜剧形式，系统评估LLMs的多维度幽默能力。

Method: 扩展现有Oogiri数据集，加入LLMs生成的回应，手动标注6个维度的5分制评分：新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智能性、共情性和整体趣味性，评估LLMs在生成和评估两个核心任务上的表现。

Result: LLMs能生成中低水平人类表现的幽默回应，但共情能力明显不足；相关性分析显示LLMs优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑共情性，这解释了LLMs无法复制人类幽默评估的原因。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默生成和评估方面存在共情缺陷，与人类评估标准存在根本差异。发布标注语料库以推动开发更具情感智能的对话系统。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

TL;DR: DoPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过检测特征图中的异常频率带并重新参数化，有效缓解注意力下沉现象，显著提升Transformer模型在长上下文（达64K tokens）中的检索准确性和推理稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE在Transformer模型中存在长度外推限制，注意力下沉现象影响长上下文处理能力，需要一种简单有效的方法来改善位置编码的性能。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为噪声特征图，基于截断矩阵熵检测异常频率带，利用特征图的噪声特性进行无参数高斯分布重新参数化。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和many-shot in-context learning任务中，DoPE显著提高了检索准确性和推理稳定性，在长达64K tokens的上下文中表现优异。

Conclusion: 位置编码的去噪策略有效缓解注意力下沉，恢复平衡的注意力模式，为改善长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

TL;DR: LoopTool是一个完全自动化的模型感知数据进化框架，通过紧密集成数据合成和模型训练来改进LLM的工具学习能力，在成本效益高的开源生态系统中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具学习受到静态合成数据管道的限制，数据生成和模型训练作为两个分离的非交互过程，无法自适应关注模型的具体弱点，且允许噪声标签持续存在，降低了训练效率。

Method: LoopTool通过三个协同模块迭代优化数据和模型：贪婪能力探测诊断模型掌握和失败的能力；判断引导标签验证使用开源评判模型查找并纠正标注错误；错误驱动数据扩展基于识别出的失败生成新的挑战性样本。

Result: 使用LoopTool训练的8B模型显著超越了其32B数据生成器，在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中达到了其规模的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 闭环自精炼数据管道可以显著增强LLM的工具使用能力，证明了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在表格问答中直接输入整个表格会导致错误答案，因为它们无法捕捉复杂的表格结构。

Method: 使用语言模型和TF-IDF的混合检索机制计算问题与单元格相似度来估计表头，通过对比学习在小数据集上训练语言模型。

Result: 在NTCIR-18 U4共享任务的TQA数据集上达到74.6%的准确率，优于GPT-4o mini等现有LLM。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了表格结构理解问题，未来计划整合更高效的文本搜索模型来缩小与人工评估的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

TL;DR: 本研究验证了基于上下文的sequentiality度量方法在评估文本连贯性方面的有效性，发现它比原始版本和仅基于主题的版本更能准确预测人类对文本组织性和连贯性的评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对先前研究中sequentiality度量方法在主题选择方面存在混淆问题且缺乏真实有效性验证的批评，本研究旨在验证仅使用上下文术语作为更概念有效和可解释替代方案的提议。

Method: 使用两个带有人工标注特征分数的论文数据集（ASAP++和ELLIPSE），比较不同版本的sequentiality度量与人类对语篇层面特征（如组织性和连贯性）评估的一致性。

Result: 基于上下文的sequentiality版本与人类对组织性和连贯性评估更一致；虽然零样本提示的LLM比单独的上下文度量更准确预测特征分数，但当与标准语言特征结合时，上下文度量比仅基于主题和原始sequentiality公式增加更多预测价值。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且互补的特征，用于自动论文评分和相关NLP任务。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，但动态学习子词分割可能优化训练目标。研究旨在探索语言模型在训练过程中如何动态优化分词，以及子词在预训练和微调过程中的演化规律。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型(SSLM)框架以支持预训练和微调，针对三种形态类型不同的语言(isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语)进行训练，从语言学角度分析子词动态变化，追踪形态学、生产力和生育力等指标。

Result: 识别出子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调过程中子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词能改善低资源复杂形态语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 动态学习子词分割是一个有前景的方法，特别是在处理低资源、形态复杂语言时，能够优化分词策略并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要优化最终任务结果，在早期训练阶段负奖励占主导时容易崩溃，这在诚实对齐任务中尤其明显，模型需要既能回答可解问题，又能识别无法从前提得出结论的情况。

Method: 提出Anchor强化学习方法，向rollouts注入真实轨迹以防止早期训练崩溃；使用基于图结构的多步演绎推理数据集，包括线性代数和逻辑推理任务，并在半数实例中通过随机扰动边来引入不可回答案例。

Result: Anchor方法稳定了学习过程，显著提高了整体推理性能；相比之下，GRPO方法（无论有无监督微调初始化）在这些任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 训练动态对于实现对齐语言模型中可靠的演绎推理至关重要，Anchor方法通过防止早期训练崩溃有效解决了诚实对齐的挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

Method: 提出POTSA框架：1）偏差补偿模块粗粒度对齐语音表示；2）在Q-Former上施加token级最优传输约束建立细粒度表示一致性；3）层调度策略将OT约束聚焦于最具语义价值的层。

Conclusion: POTSA通过最优传输技术有效缓解了多语言语音翻译中的语义偏差问题，显著提升了高低资源语言间的翻译质量，为跨语言语音理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以实现精确的多属性控制，特别是在属性要求冲突时缺乏协调机制，且无法在控制生成流程中融入迭代优化过程。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：生成阶段选择性地将LLM与所需属性分类器配对，使用加权KL散度调整token概率；优化阶段利用结合分类器分数和惩罚项的能量函数，通过迭代反馈解决属性冲突。

Result: C³TG在多个指标上显著优于基线方法，包括属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性，同时降低了毒性。

Conclusion: C³TG是一种有效且灵活的多维文本属性控制解决方案，无需昂贵的模型修改。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了LiteraryTaste数据集，用于开发个性化创意写作LLM，发现人们创意写作偏好存在差异，微调transformer编码器可有效建模个人和集体偏好，但自述偏好对建模实际偏好的效用有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们有不同的创意写作偏好，但现有LLM训练数据集将不同个人品味视为整体，需要开发能够适应每个用户偏好的个性化创意写作LLM。

Method: 构建LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读偏好数据，包括自述偏好和100对短创意写作文本的偏好标注；使用transformer编码器进行微调建模；通过LLM驱动的可解释性管道分析偏好变化。

Result: 1) 人们创意写作偏好存在分歧；2) 微调transformer编码器在建模个人和集体实际偏好时分别达到75.8%和67.7%准确率；3) 自述偏好在建模实际偏好方面效用有限。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化创意写作技术发展奠定了基础，证明了建模个人偏好的可行性，并揭示了自述偏好与实际偏好之间的差距。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高棉语模型通常只预测极性标签而不解释预测依据，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 通过微调基于指令的推理模型Qwen-3，使其能够为极性预测提供自解释，识别与极性相关的关键词或短语来支持预测。

Result: 实验结果显示，微调后的模型不仅能准确预测标签，还能提供合理的推理过程。同时贡献了一个新的高棉语极性数据集，包含短到中等长度的非正式、罗马化和混合代码高棉语表达。

Conclusion: 成功开发了可解释的高棉语极性分类器，并发布了相关数据集和模型，为高棉语NLP研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

*Zhuoqun Huang,Neil G. Marchant,Olga Ohrimenko,Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AdaptDel方法，通过可调整的删除率来改进序列分类的认证鲁棒性，在编辑距离扰动下实现更强的认证保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率处理变长序列输入（如自然语言句子）导致性能不佳，需要动态调整删除率以适应不同输入特性。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，基于输入特性动态调整删除率；将随机平滑理论框架扩展到可变率删除，确保编辑距离下的可靠认证。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得强实证结果，认证区域的中值基数比最先进方法提升高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率显著提升了序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了mmJEE-Eval多模态双语基准测试，基于印度JEE Advanced考试题目，用于评估视觉语言模型的科学推理能力，发现前沿闭源模型表现优异但开源模型表现不佳，且模型在元认知推理任务上表现崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准测试无法有效区分真实科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更严格的评估标准来测试模型的深层推理能力。

Method: 构建包含1,460个英语和印地语双语问题的mmJEE-Eval基准，涵盖物理、化学和数学领域，评估17个最先进模型的表现。

Result: 前沿闭源VLMs在2025年题目上达到77-84%准确率，开源模型仅为37-45%，且所有模型在元认知推理任务上表现极差（GPT-5仅修复5.2%错误）。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval能够有效区分不同训练和推理方法的质量，其难度源于问题复杂性和推理深度而非记忆效应。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeerSC是一个动态自一致性框架，通过整合系统1和系统2推理，同时提高令牌效率和降低延迟。系统1快速计算答案熵来评估样本扩展潜力，系统2进行动态自一致性推理，实现并行生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展能提升LLM推理性能但计算成本高，现有动态自一致性方法受限于顺序请求的高延迟。

Method: 利用系统1快速计算答案熵评估样本扩展潜力，系统2进行动态自一致性推理，实现并行生成减少延迟。

Result: 相比现有方法，令牌消耗减少47%，推理延迟降低43%，性能无显著损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC通过系统1和系统2的整合，在保持性能的同时显著提升了令牌效率和推理速度。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

*Martin Vejvar,Yasutaka Fujimoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Spider4SSC数据集和S2CLite解析工具，这是一个轻量级、本体无关的解析器，可将SPARQL查询转换为Cypher查询，在Spider4SPARQL数据集上达到77.8%的解析准确率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SPARQL到Cypher转换工具需要RDF图或外部工具支持，存在解析错误率高的问题，需要开发更高效的转换方法。

Method: S2CLite采用纯基于规则的方法（受传统编程语言编译器启发），无需RDF图或外部工具，实现SPARQL到Cypher的转换。

Result: 在BSBM42和Spider4SPARQL数据集上，S2CLite解析准确率达77.8%，相比S2CTrans的44.2%显著提升；执行准确率达96.6%，优于S2CTrans 7.3%。

Conclusion: S2CLite是有效的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具，并生成了统一的Text-to-Query数据集Spider4SSC，支持SQL、SPARQL和Cypher三种查询语言。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTQ-Eval是一个多语言文本质量评估框架，通过从高质量和低质量文本示例中学习来调整内部表示，在115种语言上展现出改进的性能，并能提升下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在任务特定评估中表现有效，但尚不清楚这种能力是否能扩展到更通用的文本质量评估，特别是在多语言环境中。

Method: 首先自动生成文本质量偏好数据，然后使用这些数据训练开源基础大语言模型，使其与高质量和低质量文本的评分对齐。

Result: 在115种语言的综合评估中，所提模型展现出改进的性能，并且这种增强的评估能力还能显著提升下游任务的表现。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval框架成功地将大语言模型的评估能力扩展到多语言文本质量评估领域，证明了其在通用文本质量评估中的有效性。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在开放式文本生成和多项选择任务中自我纠正机制的不同动态，以理解任务结构对自我纠正效果的影响。

Method: 通过在不同自然语言理解和推理任务上比较两种范式的性能趋势和错误纠正行为，涵盖不同规模和家族的LLM。

Result: 开放式生成受益于重新解释和组合优化的灵活性，而多项选择可以利用更清晰的解决方案边界但受限于提供的选项。

Conclusion: 自我纠正机制的设计应考虑任务结构和输出空间之间的交互作用，这对知识密集型推理和决策导向的LLM应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMaPO提出了一种自适应边距偏好优化方法，通过动态调整边距来解决现有离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，在排名准确性和下游对齐性能上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线偏好优化方法的效果严重依赖排名准确性，但存在过拟合-欠拟合困境：对正确排名的样本施加过多梯度（过拟合），而对错误排名的样本提供不足的纠正信号（欠拟合）。

Method: 提出AMaPO算法，采用基于Z归一化和指数缩放的实例级自适应边距，动态重新分配学习努力：放大错误排名样本的梯度，抑制正确排名样本的梯度。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO不仅实现了更好的排名准确性和优越的下游对齐性能，而且针对性分析证实它成功缓解了核心的过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边距设计有效解决了离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，为语言模型对齐提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前商业多模态大语言模型在低资源语言上表现尚可，但开源社区尚未达到同等水平，因此需要为巴斯克语开发强大的多模态大语言模型。

Method: 开发了训练和评估用的图像-文本数据集，使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语变体Latxa两种大语言模型作为骨干，探索不同的数据混合训练策略。

Result: 仅需约20%的巴斯克语多模态数据即可在巴斯克语基准测试中获得良好结果；出乎意料的是，巴斯克语指令调优的骨干模型并非必需的。

Conclusion: 为其他低资源语言开发多模态大语言模型提供了可行路径，并公开释放了相关资源。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Motivation: 心理咨询需求增长与有限服务资源之间的不匹配，促使研究将大语言模型应用于该领域，但缺乏专业、统一的评估基准。

Method: 基于真实心理咨询案例构建多样化客户档案，按照专家指南进行模拟，提供基于心理学量表的多维性能评估。

Result: 评估了多个通用大语言模型和专业心理咨询模型，揭示了它们当前的局限性，并与心理学家合作分析了失败原因。

Conclusion: 为开发更全面、通用和有效的心理咨询模型提供了方向。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Motivation: 机器学习研究发展迅速，从科学出版物中提取信息有助于大规模识别研究概念和资源，从而改善对ML相关研究的理解和可复现性。

Method: 构建GSAP-ERE数据集，包含63K实体提及和35K关系，来自100篇ML论文全文。使用该数据集微调模型进行信息提取，并探索LLM的提示策略。

Result: 微调模型在命名实体识别和关系提取任务上表现优异（NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0%），显著优于最先进的LLM提示方法（NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1%）。

Conclusion: 监督模型与无监督LLM使用之间存在显著性能差距，表明需要像GSAP-ERE这样的数据集来推进学术信息提取领域的研究。

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Conclusion: TPoT策略是一种简单有效的文本预选方法，能提升人格特质预测性能并解决输入限制问题

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

Motivation: 当前研究主要关注ATS自动评估指标与人工判断的相关性，但可读性度量(如可读性公式或语言特征)与这两方面的相关性研究较少。

Method: 首先讨论ATS与可读性研究的关系，然后进行可读性度量与人工判断、可读性度量与ATS评估指标的相关性研究。

Result: 总体上，可读性度量与自动指标和人工判断的相关性不佳。三种评估简化效果的角度之间相关性较低。

Conclusion: 由于三种评估角度相关性较弱，需要明确定义ATS中的构造概念。

Abstract: Readability is a key concept in the current era of abundant written information. To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS.

TL;DR: 提出了SynClaimEval框架，用于评估合成数据在长上下文声明验证任务中的效用，涵盖输入特征、合成逻辑和解释质量三个维度。实验表明长上下文合成能提升基础指令调优模型的验证性能，特别是在增强现有人工编写数据集时，还能改善解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建用于训练和评估长上下文LLM的标注资源成本高昂，合成数据提供了可扩展的替代方案，需要系统评估其在长上下文声明验证任务中的有效性。

Method: 引入SynClaimEval框架，从三个维度评估合成数据效用：(i)输入特征：变化上下文长度并测试对域外基准的泛化；(ii)合成逻辑：控制声明复杂度和错误类型变化；(iii)解释质量：测量模型解释与预测一致性的程度。

Result: 实验表明长上下文合成能提升基础指令调优模型的验证性能，特别是在增强现有人工编写数据集时效果更好。合成还能提高解释质量，即使验证分数没有改善。

Conclusion: 合成数据不仅能增强长上下文声明验证的性能，还能提高模型的可解释性，为幻觉检测和事实核查任务提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows promise direct reasoning over long documents, reducing the need for chunking or retrieval. Constructing annotated resources for training and evaluation, however, remains costly. Synthetic data offers a scalable alternative, and we introduce SynClaimEval, a framework for evaluating synthetic data utility in long-context claim verification -- a task central to hallucination detection and fact-checking. Our framework examines three dimensions: (i) input characteristics, by varying context length and testing generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks; (ii) synthesis logic, by controlling claim complexity and error type variation; and (iii) explanation quality, measuring the degree to which model explanations provide evidence consistent with predictions. Experiments across benchmarks show that long-context synthesis can improve verification in base instruction-tuned models, particularly when augmenting existing human-written datasets. Moreover, synthesis enhances explanation quality, even when verification scores do not improve, underscoring its potential to strengthen both performance and explainability.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法在保持视频细节的同时修改嘴唇运动，但可能引入嘴唇泄漏问题，即生成的嘴唇受到参考图像影响而非仅由驱动音频决定。

Method: 使用三种互补测试设置：静音输入生成、不匹配的音频-视频配对和匹配的音频-视频合成，并引入嘴唇同步差异和基于静音音频的嘴唇同步评分等衍生指标。

Result: 该方法能够有效检测和量化嘴唇泄漏问题，并研究了不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的方法是模型无关的，为未来说话人脸生成研究建立了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视图监控系统提供了重要基准，展示了在现实部署中的实用鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了几何深度学习，还成功将欧几里得网络中已验证的多通道交互原理适应到非欧几里得领域，实现了优越的判别性和可解释性

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

TL;DR: TTM是一个无需训练、即插即用的视频生成框架，通过粗参考动画实现精确的运动控制，同时保持外观一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本的视频生成方法无法提供精确的运动控制，而需要微调的方法计算成本高且限制性强。

Method: 使用用户友好的操作（如剪切拖拽或深度重投影）获得粗参考动画作为运动线索，采用双时钟去噪策略在指定运动区域强制对齐，同时允许其他区域灵活变化。

Conclusion: TTM提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的视频生成解决方案，实现了精确的运动和外观控制，超越了仅使用文本提示的限制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别子内存库的问题，这限制了方法的灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出统一内存库框架，所有任务共享一个内存库，在训练期间通过固定大小核心集增量更新嵌入，推理阶段通过最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高检测精度的同时解决了现有方法的内存碎片化问题，在实际场景中表现出良好的鲁棒性，并将开源实现。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶事故预测中的两个关键挑战：传感器输入噪声/退化问题，以及及时可靠预测与误报抑制的平衡需求。

Method: 使用扩散模块通过迭代精化重建噪声鲁棒的图像和物体特征，同时采用时间感知的actor-critic架构进行长期时序推理和时间加权奖励优化。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂交通场景中展现出实际部署潜力，为安全关键型自动驾驶系统提供了有效的早期预警解决方案。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DSGG方法仅在有标注的物体对上训练，缺乏对非相关物体对的指导，难以在推理时识别有意义的关系

Method: RS-Net包含空间上下文编码器（带可学习上下文标记）和时序编码器，通过统一的三元组评分机制增强关系预测

Conclusion: RS-Net能有效解决关系长尾分布问题，可轻松集成到现有DSGG模型中，在保持竞争力的效率下实现优越性能

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名适配器模块移除视频特征中的私人信息，同时保持任务实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型提取的时空特征在共享或存储时会无意中泄露敏感个人信息（如肤色、性别、服装），而现有的像素级匿名化方法需要重新训练整个模型且仅适用于特定任务。

Method: 设计轻量级匿名适配器模块（AAM），采用三种训练目标：剪辑级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标和潜在一致性损失，可在冻结的视频编码器上即插即用。

Result: 在多个下游任务评估中，隐私泄露显著减少35%，同时保持接近基线的实用性能，并能有效缓解动作识别模型中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频基础模型提供了一种高效、通用的隐私保护解决方案，在保护隐私的同时维持了模型的多任务实用性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的扩展特性，发现在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和图像生成的最优扩展策略存在显著差异，生成任务需要数据量比分类任务快3-5倍增长。随着分辨率提高，模型规模需比数据量增长更快，主要瓶颈是计算资源而非训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但未被充分研究的统一视觉模型框架的扩展特性，为未来大规模视觉模型发展提供指导。

Method: 使用IsoFlops配置文件在高达7e19 FLOPs的计算预算下训练一系列Transformer模型，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和生成质量（Fréchet距离）。

Result: 发现最优扩展策略高度依赖具体任务，生成任务需要数据量比分类任务更快增长；随着分辨率提高，模型规模需比数据量增长更快；主要瓶颈是计算资源。

Conclusion: 基于计算资源每年增长4-5倍的预测，逐像素图像建模在未来五年内具有可行性，计算资源是主要限制因素而非训练数据量。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统常因训练数据中群体分布不均而继承偏见，例如人脸数据集中金发与女性的过度关联。现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据但难以保持原始数据分布。

Method: 探索多种扩散模型微调技术（LoRA和DreamBooth），通过聚类每个群体内的图像并训练每个聚类的DreamBooth模型来生成更准确的群体表示数据。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，与SOTA去偏技术Group-DRO效果相当，且在数据集偏见严重时表现更优。

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能有效生成平衡的训练数据，缓解图像分类中的群体偏见问题，特别是在严重偏见情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseKAN是一个基于图Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的自适应图框架，用于从单张图像进行2D到3D姿态提升，通过可学习的边函数和多跳特征聚合来解决GCN的局部感受野限制和频谱偏差问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统GCN方法在3D人体姿态估计中存在局部感受野限制，难以捕捉长距离依赖关系以处理遮挡和深度模糊问题，同时存在频谱偏差，优先处理低频分量而难以建模高频细节。

Method: 提出PoseKAN框架，将KAN扩展到基于图的学习，使用可学习的边函数进行数据驱动的自适应特征变换，采用多跳特征聚合、残差PoseKAN块和全局响应归一化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型在性能上可与最先进方法竞争。

Conclusion: PoseKAN通过自适应图KAN框架增强了模型的适应性和表达能力，在3D人体姿态估计中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的旋转不变3D点云学习方法，通过引入阴影姿态特征(SiPF)和旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，解决了现有方法因感受野受限导致的全局姿态信息丢失问题，显著提升了在任意旋转下的细粒度空间辨别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变方法使用手工设计的RI特征替代原始坐标，虽然保证了旋转不变性，但丢失了全局姿态信息，无法区分几何相似但空间位置不同的结构，特别是无法区分对称组件(如飞机左右机翼)。

Method: 1) 提出阴影姿态特征(SiPF)，通过学习的共享旋转生成全局一致的参考点(阴影)，将局部RI描述符与全局姿态信息结合；2) 设计旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，在特征聚合过程中集成SiPFs；3) 基于Bingham分布的任务自适应阴影定位模块，动态学习最优全局旋转。

Result: 在3D分类和部件分割基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有RI方法，特别是在需要细粒度空间辨别的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过引入阴影姿态特征和注意力机制，成功解决了旋转不变学习中的全局姿态信息丢失问题，为3D点云处理提供了更强大的旋转不变表示能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

TL;DR: 提出SAS-SSM架构，通过结构感知时空卷积和跨步扫描策略，在保持线性复杂度的同时有效建模3D人体姿态的局部和全局依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于状态空间模型的方法通过手动设计的扫描操作将2D姿态序列展平为纯时间序列，破坏了人体姿态的固有空间结构，难以捕捉复杂的姿态依赖关系。

Method: 使用结构感知时空卷积动态捕捉关节间的局部交互，然后应用跨步扫描策略构建多尺度全局结构表示，在SAS-SSM基础上构建SasMamba模型。

Conclusion: SAS-SSM能够灵活建模局部和全局姿态信息，同时保持线性计算复杂度，为3D人体姿态估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习网络通过参数共享或动量更新隐式交互，未能充分利用正样本对的互补性和相似性来提取聚类特征

Method: 设计MFAVBs模块：1)两个共享权重的ViT分别处理正样本对，融合特征输入更大ViT；2)特征分割为新的增强正样本对，通过多个FAVBs进行多重融合增强；3)特征投影到实例级和聚类级空间计算交叉熵损失

Result: 在七个公共数据集上的实验表明，MFAVBs作为对比聚类骨干网络在聚类性能上优于最先进技术

Conclusion: MFAVBs通过显式特征融合和多重增强机制，有效提升了对比学习聚类的性能

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤预后差，自动化识别其组织病理学亚区域有助于大规模形态学理解该疾病，改善临床诊断。

Method: 采用四步深度学习流程，使用EfficientNet架构（B0-B4变体）在BraTS-Path 2024数据集上对6个H&E染色组织区域进行分类。

Result: EfficientNet-B1和B4在5折交叉验证中表现最佳（F1=0.98），但在独立验证集和测试集上性能显著下降（F1=0.546和0.517）。

Conclusion: 模型在训练数据上表现优异，但泛化到新数据存在挑战，这对临床应用至关重要，需要进一步改进模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Abstract: Object recognition plays a fundamental role in how biological organisms perceive and interact with their environment. While the human visual system performs this task with remarkable efficiency, reproducing similar capabilities in artificial systems remains challenging. This study investigates VisNet, a biologically inspired neural network model, and several enhanced variants incorporating radial basis function neurons, Mahalanobis distance based learning, and retinal like preprocessing for both general object recognition and symmetry classification. By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model. These findings underscore the adaptability and biological relevance of VisNet inspired architectures, offering a powerful and interpretable framework for visual recognition in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: SemBridge框架有效解决了弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识蒸馏问题，在遥感场景分类等实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

Conclusion: LLM结构先验与轻量级和预训练架构都具有互补性，学习到的实例自适应门控优于固定权重，开源LLM可实现隐私保护部署

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

TL;DR: NAMEA是一种新颖的集成攻击方法，通过整合集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度来提升对抗样本在异构模型架构间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成攻击在跨异构模型架构迁移时效果不佳，主要原因是异构代理模型的梯度更新方向差异很大，难以在充分利用个体模型的同时减少集成模型的梯度方差。

Method: 设计NAMEA集成攻击，首次将集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度整合到迭代梯度优化过程中。通过元学习方式分别合并注意力和非注意力区域的梯度，融合CNN和ViT的迁移信息。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，NAMEA优于当前最先进的集成攻击AdaEA和SMER，平均分别提升15.0%和9.6%。

Conclusion: 这是首次探索集成非注意力在提升跨架构可迁移性方面的能力，为发起集成攻击提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双向参考帧协调视频压缩方法BRHVC，通过双向运动收敛和双向上下文融合技术，有效优化双向参考帧的利用，在HEVC数据集上超越了传统编码方法VTM-RA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩相比P帧压缩研究较少，虽然双向参考帧能提供更好的压缩性能，但分层编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层次上，两个参考帧的贡献可能不平衡。

Method: 提出BRHVC方法，包含双向运动收敛(BMC)和双向上下文融合(BCF)。BMC在运动压缩中收敛多个光流，实现更大尺度的精确运动补偿；BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明BRHVC超越了之前最先进的神经视频压缩方法，甚至在HEVC数据集上超过了传统编码方法VTM-RA（随机访问配置）。

Conclusion: BRHVC通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，能够有效协调双向参考帧，显著提升神经B帧视频压缩性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分形生成模型(FGMs)在生成高质量图像方面很有效，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出图像的多样性。

Method: 提出可学习的HD估计方法，直接从图像嵌入预测HD；采用基于HD的损失函数和单调动量调度策略；在推理时使用HD引导的拒绝采样来选择几何更丰富的输出。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，FGM-HD框架相比原始FGMs实现了39%的输出多样性提升，同时保持相当的图像质量。

Conclusion: 这是首个将HD引入FGM的工作，有效增强了生成输出的多样性，并为FGM发展提供了理论贡献。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

TL;DR: AuthSig是一个基于生成模型和水印的静态电子签名框架，通过将认证信息嵌入签名图像来防止恶意复制和重用，实现"一次签名，一次使用"策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无纸化工作流程的普及，静态扫描签名因其便利性仍然广泛使用，但这些签名几乎失去了认证属性，无法可靠验证且易受恶意复制和重用攻击。

Method: 利用人类视觉系统对细微风格变化不敏感的特性，AuthSig在生成过程中精细调节风格嵌入来隐式编码水印位，并引入关键点驱动的数据增强策略来增强风格多样性以支持鲁棒的水印嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示，AuthSig在数字域失真和签名特定退化下实现了超过98%的提取准确率，即使在打印扫描场景下仍保持有效。

Conclusion: AuthSig通过将认证信息绑定到签名图像，有效解决了静态电子签名的认证和安全问题，为实际应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微动脉瘤是糖尿病视网膜病变的最早病理标志，但传统手动筛查劳动强度大且容易出错。现有基于扩散的异常检测方法存在身份映射、难以区分微动脉瘤与其他异常、正常特征重建不佳三个关键问题，阻碍了临床应用。

Result: 在IDRiD和e-ophtha MA数据集上的综合实验表明，WDT-MD在像素级和图像级微动脉瘤检测方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: WDT-MD框架显著提升了微动脉瘤检测性能，为改善早期糖尿病视网膜病变筛查提供了重要前景。

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Conclusion: 所提出的模型能够有效处理噪声污染和强度不均匀性，在图像分割任务中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开放集目标检测器仅依赖基于文本描述或视觉示例的正提示，在面对视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物时表现脆弱。

Method: 提出统一视觉提示编码器处理正负视觉提示，训练免费的负向否定计算模块动态抑制负响应，以及负向否定铰链损失增强正负嵌入的区分性。

Result: 在零样本检测中表现出色，显著缩小了视觉提示与文本提示方法之间的性能差距，在长尾场景中表现尤为突出（LVIS-minival上51.2 AP_r）。

Conclusion: 负提示成为推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR基准测试中，Owl显著减少幻觉，在保持忠实度的同时达到新的SOTA水平。

Conclusion: Owl通过因果建模和注意力重加权有效缓解物体幻觉，同时保持视觉语言理解能力。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Conclusion: USF-Net为地面云外推任务提供了一个高效准确的解决方案，同时发布了ASI-CIS数据集，推动了光伏发电系统的发展。

Abstract: Ground-based remote sensing cloud image sequence extrapolation is a key research area in the development of photovoltaic power systems. However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common "ghosting effect." It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation.

This method models the dehazing process as a progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow, providing efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality dehazing. Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments show that 4KDehazeFlow exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods. It delivers a 2dB PSNR increase and better performance in dense haze and color fidelity.

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

TL;DR: VietMEAgent是一个针对越南文化的多模态可解释VQA框架，通过文化对象检测和结构化程序生成，结合文化知识库实现答案预测和解释的紧密耦合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA系统在处理文化特定内容时受限，因为文化知识在训练语料中代表性不足且推理过程对用户不透明。

Method: 集成文化对象检测骨干网络和结构化程序生成层，构建双模态解释模块，结合视觉注意力证据和结构化文本推理。

Result: 构建了越南文化VQA数据集，展示了基于编程方法在文化AI中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该系统提供透明解释，揭示计算原理和文化背景，支持教育和文化保护，强调可解释性和文化敏感性。

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

Motivation: 现有TTC方法仅基于对抗输入的梯度生成反攻击，搜索空间狭窄，导致反攻击过拟合且缺乏多样性，无法充分中和广泛的对抗扰动。

Method: 提出方向正交反攻击(DOC)，结合正交梯度方向和动量更新来扩展反攻击空间探索，增加扰动多样性，同时基于平均余弦相似度设计方向敏感度评分来提升反攻击效果。

Result: 在16个数据集上的实验表明，DOC在各种攻击下提高了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了有竞争力的干净准确率。

Conclusion: 增强反攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对于提高测试时防御的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC方法通过扩展搜索空间和增加扰动多样性有效提升了防御能力。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: 组合增量学习框架能够有效提升模型在组合零样本学习任务中的组合泛化能力，适用于现实世界不断变化的数据环境。

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Byunghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UL-TTA是一种无需训练和反向传播的测试时适应框架，通过在线EM风格过程仅调整logit级参数（类别原型、先验和温度），在领域偏移下显著提升CLIP等视觉语言模型的准确性和校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法需要反向传播、协方差估计或大量内存，不适用于流式和边缘场景。VLMs在领域偏移下存在特征漂移、类别先验不匹配和严重校准错误问题。

Method: 冻结骨干网络，仅在线调整logit级参数：使用选择性样本过滤、闭式贝叶斯更新原型和先验、解耦预测与校准温度、轻量防护机制防止长流漂移。

Result: 在多个大规模跨域和OOD基准测试中，UL-TTA平均提升top-1准确率4.7个百分点，降低ECE 20-30%，延迟开销小于8%，在长达20万样本的流式测试中无崩溃。

Conclusion: logit级贝叶斯适应足以在领域偏移下为VLMs实现最先进的准确率-校准权衡，无需更新任何骨干网络参数。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了Kuzushiji OCR在噪声处理方面的空白，为相关研究提供了新的基准和评估标准。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Method: 基于图像到图像的生成框架，将数字高程模型映射到洪水深度预测，使用简化淹没模型嵌入水动力先验，并采用基于变压器的降雨编码器捕捉降水时间依赖性。

Result: 在台湾台南26公里研究区域使用182个降雨场景（24-720毫米/24小时）进行测试，结果表明PIFF为洪水预测和响应提供了有效的数据驱动替代方案。

Conclusion: PIFF通过将物理约束与数据驱动学习相结合，能够捕捉降雨、地形、SPM和洪水之间的因果关系，实现准确、实时的洪水测绘。

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

Conclusion: MACEval为大模型评估开辟了新方向，提供了一种动态、可持续的评估框架。

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

Conclusion: PressTrack-HMR展示了仅使用压力信号进行多人全局人体网格恢复的可行性，为隐私保护的多人物体运动分析提供了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Method: 使用八叉树变换器提取层次局部描述符，提出可学习的多尺度几何验证模块减少重排序失败，采用从粗到精的配准方法。

Result: 在CS-Wild-Places数据集上平均Recall@1达到90.7%，比基线提升29.6个百分点；在Wild-Places和MulRan上分别达到91.7%和96.0%；97.2%的6-DoF配准尝试误差低于2米和5度。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高性能的同时，相比RANSAC在密集点云上的运行时间提升两个数量级，多尺度重排序模块平均减少约2倍的定位误差。

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Result: 在GenVidBench基准测试中，仅使用单生成器训练的DBINDS实现了强大的跨生成器性能，在有限数据设置下表现出良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DBINDS通过分析潜在空间动态而非像素特征，有效解决了AI生成视频检测的泛化问题，为内容安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型越来越多地用于直接从图像生成皮肤病诊断叙述，但可靠的评估仍然是临床负责任部署的主要瓶颈。

Method: 构建DermBench基准，包含4000张真实皮肤病图像和专家认证的诊断叙述；训练DermEval无参考多模态评估器，能够对图像和生成叙述进行结构化评价。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可靠的多模态模型诊断能力和可信度测量，支持细粒度的病例分析和模型局限性识别。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常出现幻觉问题，特别是在对象存在性、属性和关系方面的错误，这影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: TACO将回答分解为原子查询，通过改写减少对措辞的敏感性，使用自一致性（黑盒）或自置信度（灰盒）聚合来估计置信度，最后用语言模型精炼答案。

Result: 在五个基准测试（POPE、MME、HallusionBench、AMBER和MM-Hal Bench）上，使用两个MLLM（LLaVA-1.5-7B和CogVLM2）的实验表明，TACO持续优于直接提示和视觉对比解码，减少了系统偏差并改善了置信度校准。

Conclusion: TACO框架有效增强了多模态大语言模型的忠实性，证明了其在缓解幻觉问题方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常学习空间纠缠的表示，将判别性前景特征与虚假背景相关性混淆，损害模型可解释性和鲁棒性。需要从信息论角度理解梯度归因机制。

Method: 提出空间信息瓶颈(S-IB)：最大化前景VJP与输入的互信息，最小化背景区域的互信息，鼓励网络仅在类别相关空间区域编码信息。

Result: 在五个基准测试上，六种解释方法均获得普遍改进，实现更好的前景集中和背景抑制，同时保持分类准确率提升。

Conclusion: 通过直接优化训练期间VJP的空间结构，可以改善各种解释范式的可视化质量，无需方法特定调优。

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少区分神经网络架构与信号选择的作用，本文旨在系统评估这两个方面对能量消耗估计的影响。

Method: 比较经典基线方法与新神经网络架构，评估单信号、信号对和分组传感器输入在不同身体活动中的表现。

Result: 分钟通气量是最佳单信号，Transformer模型表现最优（RMSE 0.87 W/kg）；低强度活动误差更低（RMSE 0.29 W/kg），高强度活动误差较大但标准化误差相当；存在显著的个体间差异。

Conclusion: 信号选择和模型架构都重要，分钟通气量是最佳单信号，Transformer表现最优，个体差异显著需要自适应建模策略。

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/Sarvibabakhani/deeplearning-biosignals-ee .

TL;DR: RichKD提出了一种多教师知识蒸馏框架，融合传统视觉教师和CLIP视觉语言模型的知识，通过多提示文本指导增强知识多样性，提升学生模型的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性，忽略了跨模态表示的潜力。CLIP的视觉语言知识作为补充监督源在知识蒸馏中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出简单有效的框架，融合传统教师和CLIP的logits和特征。通过CLIP的多提示文本指导，融合监督同时捕获数据集特定和语义丰富的视觉线索。

Result: 方法在多个基准测试中优于现有基线，融合教师产生更自信可靠的预测，显著增加自信正确案例，减少自信错误案例。同时改善logit分布，提高类间一致性和蒸馏质量。

Conclusion: RichKD通过融合CLIP的视觉语言知识，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能，在分布偏移和输入损坏下表现出更强的鲁棒性，证明了跨模态知识在蒸馏中的价值。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: FQ-PETR是一个针对PETR系列3D检测模型的全量化框架，通过三种创新技术解决量化过程中的精度损失问题，在W8A8量化下实现接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降）的同时减少75%延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETR系列模型在3D检测基准上表现出色，但存在计算成本高和内存占用大的部署挑战。直接应用现有量化方法会导致严重的精度下降，主要由于多模态特征间的显著幅度差异和非线性算子量化效率低的问题。

Method: 提出三种关键技术：1）量化友好的LiDAR射线位置嵌入（QFPE），用单点采样替代多点采样；2）双查找表（DULUT）算法，用两个级联线性查找表近似复杂非线性函数；3）数值稳定后量化（QANS），在softmax数值稳定后进行量化以减少注意力失真。

Result: 在PETR、StreamPETR、PETRv2、MV2d等模型上，FQ-PETR在W8A8量化下实现了接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降），同时将延迟降低了75%，显著优于现有PTQ和QAT基线方法。

Conclusion: FQ-PETR成功解决了PETR系列模型量化部署的关键挑战，在保持高精度的同时大幅提升了推理效率，为自动驾驶中的3D检测模型实际部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Conclusion: TDCNet通过有效提取和增强时空特征，能够准确检测移动红外小目标，在复杂背景下抑制伪运动杂波，显著提升检测性能

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

Conclusion: Flora方法通过创新的语义调整和流分类器设计，有效解决了零样本骨架动作识别中的关键挑战，在数据稀缺情况下仍能保持优异性能。

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Conclusion: 该框架通过迭代视觉优化实现了鲁棒的域不变定位，新基准为支气管镜导航的标准化进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Conclusion: 双教师知识蒸馏框架有效解决了架构不匹配问题，通过协同利用ViT和CNN教师的优势，显著提升了轻量CNN学生的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: vMFCoOp是一个基于超球面流形的框架，通过估计von Mises-Fisher分布来对齐LLM和CLIP模型的语义偏差，实现稳健的生物医学提示学习和优越的少样本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在LLM与CLIP模型间的语义错位问题，缺乏跨基础模型家族的可扩展性，且传统欧几里得空间优化无法建模统一表示或应用局部几何约束，导致复杂生物医学图像中的模态差距扩大。

Method: 提出vMFCoOp框架，在共享超球面流形上逆估计von Mises-Fisher分布，通过统一语义锚点对齐任意LLM和CLIP骨干网络的语义偏差，基于三个互补约束实现稳健提示学习。

Result: 在14个医学数据集、12种医学成像模态和13个解剖区域上表现一致提升，在准确性、泛化性和临床适用性方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物医学视觉语言模型提供了可扩展的提示学习解决方案，将在更多下游应用中扩展，相关资源将通过GitHub共享。

Abstract: Recent advances in context optimization (CoOp) guided by large language model (LLM)-distilled medical semantic priors offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering and full fine-tuning for adapting biomedical CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs). However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work will be continuously expanded to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RF-DETR是一个轻量级专业检测变换器，通过神经架构搜索为任何目标数据集发现准确率-延迟帕累托曲线，显著提升开放词汇检测器在真实世界数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇检测器在COCO上表现优异，但在包含预训练中未见类别的真实世界数据集上泛化能力差。需要一种轻量级方法，而不是简单地微调大型视觉语言模型。

Method: 基于预训练基础网络，在目标数据集上微调，通过权重共享神经架构搜索评估数千种网络配置，无需重新训练即可获得不同准确率-延迟权衡。重新审视NAS的"可调旋钮"以提升DETR到不同目标域的迁移性。

Result: RF-DETR在COCO和Roboflow100-VL上显著优于先前最先进的实时方法。RF-DETR (nano)在COCO上达到48.0 AP，比D-FINE (nano)高5.3 AP且延迟相似；RF-DETR (2x-large)在Roboflow100-VL上比GroundingDINO (tiny)高1.2 AP且快20倍。

Conclusion: RF-DETR (2x-large)是首个在COCO上超过60 AP的实时检测器，为开放词汇检测提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary detectors achieve impressive performance on COCO, but often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with out-of-distribution classes not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the "tunable knobs" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO. Our code is at https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr

*Graham L. Bishop*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文批评当前生物声学AI系统忽视AI递归认知与其他物种递归通信过程相遇时的根本问题，提出需要从通用模式识别转向不同递归认知形式之间的外交式相遇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物声学AI系统虽然取得了跨物种的优异表现，但忽视了AI作为递归认知代理与其他物种递归通信过程相遇时的根本问题，即AI自身的递归信息处理可能系统性地模糊或扭曲其他物种的通信结构。

Method: 借鉴哲学家Yuk Hui关于递归性和偶然性的工作，分析AI系统作为递归认知代理如何通过其注意力机制、迭代处理和反馈回路处理动物通信，提出需要重新概念化生物声学AI。

Result: 识别出双重偶然性问题：每个物种的通信都通过偶然的生态和进化条件产生，而AI系统则通过其偶然的架构和训练条件处理这些信号。

Conclusion: 解决这一挑战需要将生物声学AI从通用模式识别重新概念化为不同递归认知形式之间的外交式相遇，这对模型设计、评估框架和研究方法具有重要影响。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型表现出卓越的流畅性，但研究者仍在努力提取其更强的推理能力。基于对LLM计算的搜索式理解，本文旨在系统化理解LLM推理和优化。

Method: 设计实验比较简单线性管道与包含递归精炼层的复杂结构化管道。构建反映美国开国元勋历史人物的多智能体模型，使用RAG增强语料库，针对三个当代政治议题生成回应。

Result: 复杂模型在所有九个测试案例中均优于简单模型，平均仲裁分数为88.3对71.7。复杂模型的论证在分析深度、结构细微差别和策略框架方面更优越。

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理的强大架构特征。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在推理、洞察和工具使用方面取得突破，但在执行人类、组织和社会规模的扩展过程时，由于持续的错误率而无法规模化，需要解决长期任务执行的问题。

Method: 采用极端任务分解方法，将任务分解为可由专注微代理处理的子任务，通过高效的多代理投票方案在每个步骤应用错误纠正。

Result: 成功解决了超过100万步LLM推理的任务且零错误，理论上可扩展到更高级别。

Conclusion: 相比持续改进当前LLMs，大规模分解代理过程（MDAPs）可能为组织和社会级别的问题提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理在显式推理中表现出弱短期记忆，将链式交互视为离散屏幕理解，缺乏对历史交互的感知，这限制了GUI自动化的性能

Method: HAR框架包括构建反思学习场景、合成定制修正指南、设计混合RL奖励函数，开发了HAR-GUI-3B端到端模型

Result: 在多个GUI相关基准测试上的综合评估证明了方法的有效性和泛化能力

Conclusion: HAR框架成功将推理模式从历史无关转变为历史感知，为GUI代理提供了稳定的短期记忆和可靠的屏幕细节感知能力

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Motivation: 现有零样本方法忽视了视觉边界对轨迹和观测的根本影响，无法推断部分视觉观测与导航目标之间的关系，导致长时程规划性能受限。

Method: 提出SCOPE框架：1) 使用视觉语言模型估计探索潜力；2) 构建时空潜力图捕捉边界动态；3) 引入自我重新考虑机制重新评估和优化先前决策。

Result: 在两个不同的具身导航任务上，SCOPE比最先进基线准确率提升4.6%，核心组件带来更好的校准、更强的泛化能力和更高的决策质量。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过显式利用边界信息和自我重新考虑机制，在零样本视觉导航中实现了更明智和目标相关的决策，显著提升了导航性能。

Abstract: Embodied visual navigation remains a challenging task, as agents must explore unknown environments with limited knowledge. Existing zero-shot studies have shown that incorporating memory mechanisms to support goal-directed behavior can improve long-horizon planning performance. However, they overlook visual frontier boundaries, which fundamentally dictate future trajectories and observations, and fall short of inferring the relationship between partial visual observations and navigation goals. In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\% in accuracy. Further analysis demonstrates that its core components lead to improved calibration, stronger generalization, and higher decision quality.

Conclusion: MoE增强的多层次协作范式展现了强大性能，验证了端到端多智能体框架在自动驾驶中的有效性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving holds transformative potential but remains fundamentally constrained by the limited perception and isolated decision-making with standalone intelligence. While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making. To adapt to diverse downstream tasks and further enhance the quality of multi-level fusion, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance the BEV representations. We further extend MoE into the decoder to better capture diverse motion patterns. Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, a 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and a 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared with UniV2X, showcasing the strength of our MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm.

Conclusion: 为传统方法提供了一个可扩展且高效的替代方案，非常适合移动机器人和可穿戴设备应用。

Abstract: Traditional Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) methods rely on a 'pose-centric' paradigm, which computes absolute camera poses from the local map thus requires large-scale landmark maintenance and continuous map optimization. This approach is computationally expensive, limiting their real-time performance on resource-constrained devices. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sparse Motion Field Visual Odometry (SMF-VO), a lightweight, 'motion-centric' framework. Our approach directly estimates instantaneous linear and angular velocity from sparse optical flow, bypassing the need for explicit pose estimation or expensive landmark tracking. We also employed a generalized 3D ray-based motion field formulation that works accurately with various camera models, including wide-field-of-view lenses. SMF-VO demonstrates superior efficiency and competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets, achieving over 100 FPS on a Raspberry Pi 5 using only a CPU. Our work establishes a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional methods, making it highly suitable for mobile robotics and wearable devices.

Conclusion: SPIDER作为通用物理重新定位方法，能够处理多样化质量数据并生成高质量数据，有效支持强化学习等策略学习方法。

Abstract: Learning dexterous and agile policy for humanoid and dexterous hand control requires large-scale demonstrations, but collecting robot-specific data is prohibitively expensive. In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning. As a universal physics-based retargeting method, SPIDER can work with diverse quality data and generate diverse and high-quality data to enable efficient policy learning with methods like RL.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in improving robustness and generalization for end-to-end robotic manipulation. However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SpatialActor通过解耦语义和几何实现了鲁棒的机器人操作，在噪声环境和空间扰动下保持良好性能

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires precise spatial understanding to interact with objects in the real world. Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations. Project Page: https://shihao1895.github.io/SpatialActor

Abstract: Large Vision Models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated strong capabilities in segmenting and semantically understanding object parts, even in cluttered, crowded scenes. However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.

TL;DR: MicroEvoEval是首个面向图像基微结构演化预测的综合基准，评估了14种模型在4个代表性任务上的表现，发现现代架构(如VMamba)在长期稳定性、物理保真度和计算效率方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微结构演化模拟对材料设计至关重要，但现有深度学习研究缺乏标准化基准，存在模型比较不全面、过度强调数值精度而忽视物理保真度、未分析误差传播等问题。

Method: 构建MicroEvoEval基准，评估14种域特定和通用架构模型，在4个微结构演化任务上进行短期和长期评估，采用多维度评估框架包括数值精度、计算成本和结构保持指标。

Result: 现代架构(如VMamba)不仅实现了优越的长期稳定性和物理保真度，而且计算效率提高了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 研究强调了全面评估的必要性，并确定现代架构是开发高效可靠数据驱动材料科学替代模型的有前景方向。

Abstract: Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音相关检索器在处理长音频时性能不足，需要改进以支持实际的长形式口语问答应用。

Method: 提出CLSR模型，在模态对齐前加入中间步骤将声学特征转换为类文本表示，更有效地弥合模态差距。

Result: 在四个跨模态检索数据集上的实验表明，CLSR超越了端到端语音检索器和结合语音识别与文本检索的流水线方法。

Conclusion: CLSR为推进实用的长形式口语问答应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spoken question answering (SQA) in recent years. However, many existing methods, including large audio language models, struggle with processing long audio. Follow the success of retrieval augmented generation, a speech-related retriever shows promising in help preprocessing long-form speech. But the performance of existing speech-related retrievers is lacking. To address this challenge, we propose CLSR, an end-to-end contrastive language-speech retriever that efficiently extracts question-relevant segments from long audio recordings for downstream SQA task. Unlike conventional speech-text contrastive models, CLSR incorporates an intermediate step that converts acoustic features into text-like representations prior to alignment, thereby more effectively bridging the gap between modalities. Experimental results across four cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that CLSR surpasses both end-to-end speech related retrievers and pipeline approaches combining speech recognition with text retrieval, providing a robust foundation for advancing practical long-form SQA applications.

Motivation: 传统ARX模型无法处理区间数据，需要开发能够处理不确定性数据的新模型结构。

Method: 定义了区间数与实数矩阵之间的新运算，构建了区间ARX模型，并将其应用于移动模式建模。

Result: 仿真结果表明，基于新区间ARX模型的移动模式建模对模型参数变化具有鲁棒性，性能优于先前工作。

Conclusion: 提出的区间ARX模型能有效处理区间数据，在烧结过程中表现出优越的建模性能。

Abstract: In this paper,firstly,to overcome the shortcoming of traditional ARX model, a new operator between an interval number and a real matrix is defined, and then it is applied to the traditional ARX model to get a new type of structure interval ARX model that can deal with interval data, which is defined as interval ARX model (IARX). Secondly,the IARX model is applied to moving pattern-based modeling. Finally,to verify the validity of the proposed modeling method,it is applied to a sintering process. The simulation results show the moving pattern-based modeling using the new type of interval ARX model is robust to variation in parameters of the model, and the performance of the modeling using the proposed IARX is superior to that of the previous work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAR是一种新的训练方法，通过渐进深度课程学习和分层监督加权，显著降低了递归推理模型的训练成本，在保持高准确率的同时实现了1.71倍训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归推理模型虽然性能优异，但训练成本高昂（约36 GPU小时/数据集），限制了广泛应用和研究。

Method: 提出CGAR方法：1）渐进深度课程学习：动态调整递归深度从浅到深；2）分层监督加权：对监督步骤应用指数衰减重要性权重。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上，CGAR实现1.71倍训练加速（10.93到6.38小时），准确率仅下降0.63%（86.65%到86.02%）。

Conclusion: 基于架构深度的原则性课程学习能够在有限硬件上高效训练递归推理模型，实现训练效率和解决方案质量的双重提升。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM-ABS框架来研究大语言模型代理在独裁者游戏中的行为，发现系统提示对模型行为有显著影响，代理通常表现出强烈的公平偏好，但提示敏感性仍是持续挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了系统提示在塑造LLM代理行为中的作用，且未考虑结果对提示微小变化的敏感性，而研究LLM复杂行为特征需要稳健的基线。

Method: 提出LLM-ABS框架：(i)探索不同系统提示对模型行为的影响；(ii)使用中性提示变体获取更可靠的代理偏好洞察；(iii)分析LLM代理对开放式指令响应的语言特征以理解其行为背后的推理。

Result: 代理通常表现出强烈的公平偏好，系统提示对其行为有显著影响。从语言角度看，模型以不同方式表达其响应。

Conclusion: 尽管提示敏感性仍是持续挑战，但提出的框架为LLM代理行为研究提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BayesQ是一个基于后验期望损失的贝叶斯后训练量化框架，通过高斯后验拟合、协方差白化、码本设计和混合精度分配来优化量化过程，在低比特量化下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的后训练量化方法没有充分考虑权重的不确定性，BayesQ旨在通过贝叶斯框架将低比特量化重新定义为不确定性感知的风险最小化问题。

Method: 拟合轻量级高斯后验权重，通过后验协方差进行白化，设计码本最小化后验期望失真，使用贪心背包算法分配混合精度，并通过蒙特卡洛方法处理任务感知代理。

Result: 在ResNet-50和BERT-base上，相比GPTQ等强基线方法，在3.0/3.5/4.0比特权重下分别提升ImageNet top-1准确率+1.5/+0.7/+0.3个百分点和GLUE分数+1.1/+0.4/+0.2分。

Conclusion: BayesQ成功将低比特量化重构为不确定性感知的风险最小化问题，提供了一个实用且高效的后训练量化管道，仅需与GPTQ相当的预处理时间。

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

Trained on billion-scale real-world transactions, TGPT significantly improves downstream classification performance against a competitive production model and exhibits advantages over baselines in generating future transactions. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations utilizing a diverse collection of company transaction datasets spanning multiple downstream tasks, thereby enabling a thorough assessment of TGPT's effectiveness and efficiency in comparison to established methodologies. Furthermore, we examine the incorporation of LLM-derived embeddings within TGPT and benchmark its performance against fine-tuned LLMs, demonstrating that TGPT achieves superior predictive accuracy as well as faster training and inference. We anticipate that the architectural innovations and practical guidelines from this work will advance foundation models for transaction-like data and catalyze future research in this emerging field.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将贝叶斯推理应用于添加的适配器模块，而Bayesian-MoE直接针对MoE模型中已有的专家路径，利用其模块化设计进行可处理的块级后验估计。

Method: 对每个专家的第二个线性层应用结构化拉普拉斯近似，使用克罗内克分解低秩近似来建模曲率，并推导可扩展的预测不确定性和边际似然估计。

Result: 在常识推理基准测试中，使用Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE的实验表明，Bayesian-MoE在预期校准误差(ECE)和负对数似然(NLL)方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在不修改原始训练过程或引入新参数的情况下，有效提高了下游决策的可靠性。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Conclusion: AdaCuRL通过自适应课程强化学习有效解决了推理任务中的训练挑战，为增强大语言模型的推理能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准内在方法在高维非欧几里得流形上聚类的计算挑战，传统方法计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用p-Fréchet映射F^p将流形数据嵌入到低维欧几里得空间，然后应用k-means等标准欧几里得聚类技术。

Result: 在合成和真实SPD(n)数据上的实验显示，运行时间比内在流形方法减少高达两个数量级，同时保持高聚类精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，解决了现有方法在复杂场景下的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

TL;DR: FSampler是一个无需训练、与采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散采样。它使用有限差分预测器从历史去噪信号中预测epsilon，在选定步骤替代模型调用，同时保持采样器更新规则不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少扩散模型采样过程中的计算开销，通过预测epsilon来替代部分模型调用，从而加速采样过程而不改变原有采样器的工作方式。

Method: 维护最近模型调用的去噪信号历史，使用二阶、三阶或四阶有限差分预测器外推下一个epsilon。在选定步骤用预测的epsilon替代模型调用，包含学习稳定器、梯度估计稳定器、保护窗口、周期性锚点和连续跳过上限等机制。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image和Wan 2.2模型上，FSampler减少时间8-22%，模型调用减少15-25%，保持高保真度（SSIM 0.95-0.99）。在激进自适应门控下，模型调用可减少45-50%，但保真度较低（SSIM 0.73-0.74）。

Conclusion: FSampler提供了一种有效的扩散采样加速方法，与多种采样器兼容，能在保持高质量的同时显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Abstract: Recent advancements in the direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated high-quality outputs even at early timesteps, paving the way for novel energy-efficient AI paradigms. However, the inherent non-linearity and temporal dependencies in SNNs introduce persistent challenges, such as temporal covariate shift (TCS) and unstable gradient flow with learnable neuron thresholds. In this paper, we present two key innovations: MP-Init (Membrane Potential Initialization) and TrSG (Threshold-robust Surrogate Gradient). MP-Init addresses TCS by aligning the initial membrane potential with its stationary distribution, while TrSG stabilizes gradient flow with respect to threshold voltage during training. Extensive experiments validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on both static and dynamic image datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/kookhh0827/SNN-MP-Init-TRSG

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) with millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar offers a privacy-preserving and robust alternative to camera- and wearable-based approaches. In this work, we propose the Occupancy-Gated Parallel-CNN Bi-LSTM (OG-PCL) network to process sparse 3D radar point clouds produced by mmWave sensing. Designed for lightweight deployment, the parameter size of the proposed OG-PCL is only 0.83M and achieves 91.75 accuracy on the RadHAR dataset, outperforming those existing baselines such as 2D CNN, PointNet, and 3D CNN methods. We validate the advantages of the tri-view parallel structure in preserving spatial information across three dimensions while maintaining efficiency through ablation studies. We further introduce the Occupancy-Gated Convolution (OGConv) block and demonstrate the necessity of its occupancy compensation mechanism for handling sparse point clouds. The proposed OG-PCL thus offers a compact yet accurate framework for real-time radar-based HAR on lightweight platforms.

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) still lacks a comprehensive simulation method. Existing software is developed based on models or motion-captured data, resulting in limited flexibility. To address this issue, a simulator that directly generates Doppler spectra from recorded video footage (RadHARSimulator V2) is presented in this paper. Both computer vision and radar modules are included in the simulator. In computer vision module, the real-time model for object detection with global nearest neighbor is first used to detect and track human targets in the video. Then, the high-resolution network is used to estimate two-dimensional poses of the detected human targets. Next, the three-dimensional poses of the detected human targets are obtained by nearest matching method. Finally, smooth temporal three-dimensional pose estimation is achieved through Kalman filtering. In radar module, pose interpolation and smoothing are first achieved through the Savitzky-Golay method. Second, the delay model and the mirror method are used to simulate echoes in both free-space and through-the-wall scenarios. Then, range-time map is generated using pulse compression, moving target indication, and DnCNN. Next, Doppler-time map (DTM) is generated using short-time Fourier transform and DnCNN again. Finally, the ridge features on the DTM are extracted using the maximum local energy method. In addition, a hybrid parallel-serial neural network architecture is proposed for radar-based HAR. Numerical experiments are conducted and analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed simulator and the proposed network model.

TL;DR: Routesplain是首个针对软件相关任务的LLM路由器，通过提取可解释的概念特征进行路由决策，在准确性和成本方面优于单个模型，并达到或超过所有黑盒基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在软件任务中表现差异显著，通过路由查询到合适的LLM可以提高响应质量并降低成本，但之前的工作主要关注通用目的的基于黑盒模型的LLM路由。

Method: Routesplain首先从每个查询中提取人类可解释的概念（如任务类型、领域、推理复杂度等），然后仅基于这些概念进行路由决策，提供可理解且可信的推理过程。

Result: 在16个最先进LLM和8个软件相关任务上的评估显示，Routesplain在准确性和成本方面都优于单个模型，并且达到或超过所有黑盒基线方法。

Conclusion: Routesplain通过概念级干预展示了进一步改进路由器的途径，为软件相关任务的LLM路由提供了可解释且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs now tackle a wide range of software-related tasks, yet we show that their performance varies markedly both across and within these tasks. Routing user queries to the appropriate LLMs can therefore help improve response quality while reducing cost. Prior work, however, has focused mainly on general-purpose LLM routing via black-box models. We introduce Routesplain, the first LLM router for software-related tasks, including multilingual code generation and repair, input/output prediction, and computer science QA. Unlike existing routing approaches, Routesplain first extracts human-interpretable concepts from each query (e.g., task, domain, reasoning complexity) and only routes based on these concepts, thereby providing intelligible, faithful rationales. We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements.

TL;DR: 提出ST-CLIP模型，将时空信息融入CLIP视觉语言模型，通过SCAMP提示学习方法增强交通场景理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将交通场景理解视为普通图像理解任务，忽略了时空信息和交通场景不同方面之间的相互关系

Method: 基于CLIP骨干网络，设计SCAMP提示学习方法，包含动态时空上下文表示模块和双层ST感知多角度提示学习模块

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，在复杂场景理解场景中具有优越性能，采用少样本学习策略

Conclusion: 这是首次将时空信息整合到视觉语言模型中促进交通场景理解任务的成功尝试

Abstract: Nowadays, navigation and ride-sharing apps have collected numerous images with spatio-temporal data. A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy.

TL;DR: SAMora是一个创新框架，通过图像、补丁和像素级别的自监督学习目标来捕获医学图像中的层次知识，提升SAM模型在医学图像分割中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM模型在医学图像分割中仅使用少量标注数据时性能受限的问题，充分利用医学数据中丰富但常被忽视的层次信息。

Method: 提出SAMora框架，采用图像、补丁和像素级别的互补自监督学习目标捕获层次医学知识，并引入HL-Attn层次融合模块整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在Synapse、LA和PROMISE12数据集上，SAMora在少样本和全监督设置下均优于现有SAM变体，达到最先进性能，同时将微调轮次减少90%。

Conclusion: SAMora能够有效利用医学数据的层次信息，显著提升SAM模型在医学图像分割中的性能，且兼容多种SAM变体，具有实用价值。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Yet, its performance is limited when only a small amount of labeled data is available, while there is abundant valuable yet often overlooked hierarchical information in medical data. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from self-supervised learning and propose SAMora, an innovative framework that captures hierarchical medical knowledge by applying complementary self-supervised learning objectives at the image, patch, and pixel levels. To fully exploit the complementarity of hierarchical knowledge within LoRAs, we introduce HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features while maintaining their distinct characteristics. SAMora is compatible with various SAM variants, including SAM2, SAMed, and H-SAM. Experimental results on the Synapse, LA, and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate that SAMora outperforms existing SAM variants. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot and fully supervised settings while reducing fine-tuning epochs by 90%. The code is available at https://github.com/ShChen233/SAMora.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于Swin-UNETR的深度学习框架，能够直接从CT图像和解剖轮廓预测IMRT的注量图，实现快速、自动化的放射治疗计划生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IMRT优化过程耗时且依赖专家经验，需要开发更高效的自动化方法来加速注量图生成并保持临床质量。

Method: 使用端到端的3D Swin-UNETR网络，基于99例前列腺IMRT病例（79例训练，20例测试），直接从CT图像和解剖轮廓预测九束注量图。该基于transformer的模型采用分层自注意力机制捕捉局部解剖结构和长程空间依赖关系。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到平均R²=0.95±0.02，MAE=0.035±0.008，gamma通过率85±10%(3%/3mm)，预测计划与临床计划在DVH参数上无显著差异。

Conclusion: Swin-UNETR框架实现了完全自动化、无需逆向优化的注量图预测，提高了空间一致性、准确性和效率，为自动化IMRT计划生成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate fluence map prediction is essential in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to maximize tumor coverage while minimizing dose to healthy tissues. Conventional optimization is time-consuming and dependent on planner expertise. This study presents a deep learning framework that accelerates fluence map generation while maintaining clinical quality. An end-to-end 3D Swin-UNETR network was trained to predict nine-beam fluence maps directly from volumetric CT images and anatomical contours using 99 prostate IMRT cases (79 for training and 20 for testing). The transformer-based model employs hierarchical self-attention to capture both local anatomical structures and long-range spatial dependencies. Predicted fluence maps were imported into the Eclipse Treatment Planning System for dose recalculation, and model performance was evaluated using beam-wise fluence correlation, spatial gamma analysis, and dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics. The proposed model achieved an average R^2 of 0.95 +/- 0.02, MAE of 0.035 +/- 0.008, and gamma passing rate of 85 +/- 10 percent (3 percent / 3 mm) on the test set, with no significant differences observed in DVH parameters between predicted and clinical plans. The Swin-UNETR framework enables fully automated, inverse-free fluence map prediction directly from anatomical inputs, enhancing spatial coherence, accuracy, and efficiency while offering a scalable and consistent solution for automated IMRT plan generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着阿尔茨海默病疾病修饰疗法获批，迫切需要基于低成本测量方式的早期、客观、准确临床诊断方法。

Method: 使用持久同调分析脑部结构MRI，通过Betti函数将拓扑特征转化为特征向量，结合XGBoost机器学习模型。

Result: 在二元分类任务中平均准确率97.43%、敏感性99.09%；在三分类任务中平均准确率95.47%、敏感性94.98%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需数据增强或复杂预处理，特别适合小数据集，拓扑特征与深度学习特征互补，具有与其他模型结合的潜力。

Abstract: Now that disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease have been approved by regulatory agencies, the early, objective, and accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on the lowest-cost measurement modalities possible has become an increasingly urgent need. In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology to analyze structural MRI of the brain. This approach converts topological features into powerful feature vectors through Betti functions. By integrating these feature vectors with a simple machine learning model like XGBoost, we achieve a computationally efficient machine learning model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in both binary and three-class classification tasks for ADNI 3D MRI disease diagnosis. Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets. Topological features differ significantly from those commonly extracted using convolutional filters and other deep learning machinery. Because it provides an entirely different type of information from machine learning models, it has the potential to combine topological features with other models later on.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于隐式比特分配的高效ROI图像压缩模型，通过Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement模块实现灵活的区域比特分配，在保持背景质量的同时显著提升压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ROI压缩方法主要采用显式比特分配策略，通过掩码抑制背景信息后进行量化，这种硬门控方法显著影响熵模型的统计分布，限制了压缩模型的编码性能。

Method: 提出Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement模块，包含Region-Adaptive Attention和Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention块，实现隐式比特分配；使用双解码器分别重建前景和背景图像，在数据驱动方式下优化前景增强和背景质量保持的平衡。

Result: 在COCO2017数据集上的实验表明，该方法在率失真性能上显著优于显式比特分配方法，在保持重建背景区域满意视觉质量的同时实现最优结果。

Conclusion: 这是首个利用隐式比特分配实现高质量区域自适应编码的工作，证明了隐式比特分配在ROI图像压缩中的优越性。

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression has rapidly developed due to its ability to maintain high fidelity in important regions while reducing data redundancy. However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions.

Motivation: 超低场MRI虽然更具可及性，但存在信噪比低、空间分辨率差和对比度偏离高场标准的问题。图像到图像转换可以改善外观，但受限于稀缺的配对训练数据。

Method: 在ULF-EnC挑战赛约束下（50对3D数据，无外部数据），研究任务适应的数据增强对标准深度模型的影响，包括在高场数据上的辅助任务。

Result: 强大多样的数据增强显著提高了保真度，在公开验证排行榜上获得脑掩模SSIM第三名，在最终测试排行榜上获得官方评分第四名。

Conclusion: 即使在有限配对数据条件下，适当的数据增强策略也能有效提升超低场MRI图像增强性能。

Abstract: Ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI promises broader accessibility but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduced spatial resolution, and contrasts that deviate from high-field standards. Image-to-image translation can map ULF images to a high-field appearance, yet efficacy is limited by scarce paired training data. Working within the ULF-EnC challenge constraints (50 paired 3D volumes; no external data), we study how task-adapted data augmentations impact a standard deep model for ULF image enhancement. We show that strong, diverse augmentations, including auxiliary tasks on high-field data, substantially improve fidelity. Our submission ranked third by brain-masked SSIM on the public validation leaderboard and fourth by the official score on the final test leaderboard.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图像质量问题（如模糊和构图不当）如何影响视觉语言模型为盲人和低视力人群生成的产品识别描述准确性，发现模型在无质量问题时准确率达98%，但在有质量问题时降至75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型被盲人和低视力人群广泛用于日常产品识别，但缺乏对图像质量问题如何影响模型准确性的实证研究，需要了解这些模型是否真正满足用户的信息需求。

Method: 基于对86名盲人和低视力人士的调查，系统评估图像质量问题对视觉语言模型生成描述的影响，包括模糊、构图不当等常见问题。

Result: 最佳模型在无图像质量问题时产品识别准确率达98%，但在存在质量问题时整体准确率降至75%，且随着问题叠加而显著恶化。

Conclusion: 需要以残障人士体验为中心的模型评估方法，并为HCI和ML研究人员提供具体建议，使视觉语言模型对盲人和低视力人群更加可靠。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used by blind and low-vision (BLV) people to identify and understand products in their everyday lives, such as food, personal products, and household goods. Despite their prevalence, we lack an empirical understanding of how common image quality issues, like blur and misframing of items, affect the accuracy of VLM-generated captions and whether resulting captions meet BLV people's information needs. Grounded in a survey with 86 BLV people, we systematically evaluate how image quality issues affect captions generated by VLMs. We show that the best model recognizes products in images with no quality issues with 98% accuracy, but drops to 75% accuracy overall when quality issues are present, worsening considerably as issues compound. We discuss the need for model evaluations that center on disabled people's experiences throughout the process and offer concrete recommendations for HCI and ML researchers to make VLMs more reliable for BLV people.

Conclusion: 该插件式框架有效解决多模态模糊问题，显著提升自我中心交互的用户体验。

Abstract: The performance of egocentric AI agents is fundamentally limited by multimodal intent ambiguity. This challenge arises from a combination of underspecified language, imperfect visual data, and deictic gestures, which frequently leads to task failure. Existing monolithic Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to resolve these multimodal ambiguous inputs, often failing silently or hallucinating responses. To address these ambiguities, we introduce the Plug-and-Play Clarifier, a zero-shot and modular framework that decomposes the problem into discrete, solvable sub-tasks. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic modules: (1) a text clarifier that uses dialogue-driven reasoning to interactively disambiguate linguistic intent, (2) a vision clarifier that delivers real-time guidance feedback, instructing users to adjust their positioning for improved capture quality, and (3) a cross-modal clarifier with grounding mechanism that robustly interprets 3D pointing gestures and identifies the specific objects users are pointing to. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework improves the intent clarification performance of small language models (4--8B) by approximately 30%, making them competitive with significantly larger counterparts. We also observe consistent gains when applying our framework to these larger models. Furthermore, our vision clarifier increases corrective guidance accuracy by over 20%, and our cross-modal clarifier improves semantic answer accuracy for referential grounding by 5%. Overall, our method provides a plug-and-play framework that effectively resolves multimodal ambiguity and significantly enhances user experience in egocentric interaction.

Abstract: Housing cooperative is a common type of multifamily building ownership in Sweden. Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice.

Result: 发现播客采用固定模板结构，将不同语言和文化内容标准化为美国中西部口音和白人中产阶级文化默认值。

Conclusion: AI播客标志着播客媒体从多元公共领域向抽象化发展的转变，背离了传统播客针对特定社群和回应听众互动的模式。

Abstract: This paper analyses AI-generated podcasts produced by Google's NotebookLM, which generates audio podcasts with two chatty AI hosts discussing whichever documents a user uploads. While AI-generated podcasts have been discussed as tools, for instance in medical education, they have not yet been analysed as media. By uploading different types of text and analysing the generated outputs I show how the podcasts' structure is built around a fixed template. I also find that NotebookLM not only translates texts from other languages into a perky standardised Mid-Western American accent, it also translates cultural contexts to a white, educated, middle-class American default. This is a distinct development in how publics are shaped by media, marking a departure from the multiple public spheres that scholars have described in human podcasting from the early 2000s until today, where hosts spoke to specific communities and responded to listener comments, to an abstraction of the podcast genre.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于神经符号距离场学习中曲率正则化的有限差分框架，替代计算昂贵的二阶自动微分方法，显著降低GPU内存使用和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用二阶自动微分来强制曲率先验，虽然准确但计算成本高昂。其他方法通过避免显式Hessian组装来减少开销，但仍需要高阶微分。

Method: 使用轻量级有限差分模板替代二阶微分操作，通过泰勒展开近似二阶导数，截断误差为O(h^2)，可作为高斯曲率和秩亏损失的直接替代品。

Result: 实验表明有限差分变体实现了与自动微分对应方法相当的重建保真度，同时将GPU内存使用和训练时间减少了高达两倍。在稀疏、不完整和非CAD数据上的测试验证了该方法的鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: 提出的有限差分框架为曲率感知SDF学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce a finite-difference framework for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning. Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.
